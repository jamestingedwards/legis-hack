39 Ancillary power of Court or Disputes Tribunal to grant relief

1 Where a consumer cancels under this Act a contract for the supply of services, a Court or a Disputes Tribunal, in any proceedings or on application made for the purpose, may from time to time if it is just and practicable to do so, make an order or orders granting relief under this section.

2 An order under this section may

a Vest in any party to the proceedings the whole or any part of any real or personal property that was the subject of the contract or was the whole or part of the consideration for it:

b Direct any party to the proceedings to transfer or assign to any other such party or to give him or her the possession of the whole or any part of any real or personal property that was the subject of the contract or was the whole or part of the consideration for it:

c Without prejudice to any right to recover damages, direct any party to the proceedings to pay to any other such party such sum as the Court or Tribunal thinks just:

d Direct any party to the proceedings to do or refrain from doing in relation to any other party any act or thing as the Court or Tribunal thinks just:

e Permit a supplier to retain the whole or part of any money paid or other consideration provided in respect of the services under the contract.

3 Any such order, or any provision of it, may be made upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the Court or the Tribunal thinks fit, not being in any case a term or condition that would have the effect of preventing a claim for damages by any party.

4 In considering whether to make an order under this section, and in considering the terms of any order it proposes to make, the Court or Tribunal shall have regard to

a Any benefit or advantage obtained by the consumer by reason of anything done by the supplier in or for the purpose of supplying the service; and

b The value, in the opinion of the Court or Tribunal, of any work or services performed by the supplier in or for the purpose of supplying the service; and

c Any expenditure incurred by the consumer or the supplier in or for the purpose of the performance of the service; and

d The extent to which the supplier or the consumer was or would have been able to perform the contract in whole or in part; and

e Such other matters as the Court or the Tribunal thinks fit.

5 No order shall be made under subsection (2)(a) of this section that would have the effect of depriving a person, not being a party to the contract, of the possession of or any estate or interest in any property acquired by him or her in good faith and for valuable consideration.

6 No order shall be made under this section in respect of any property if any party to the contract has so altered his or her position in relation to the property, whether before or after the cancellation of the contract, that, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it would in the opinion of the Court or Tribunal be inequitable to any party to make such an order.

7 An application for an order under this section may be made by

a The consumer; or

b The supplier; or

c Any person claiming through or under the consumer or the supplier; or

d Any other person if it is material for him or her to know whether relief under this section will be granted.

40 Saving
Nothing in this Part of this Act limits or affects

a Any rule of law or any enactment which imposes on the supplier a duty stricter than that imposed by this Part of this Act; or

b Any rule of law whereby any term not inconsistent with this Part of this Act is to be implied in a contract for the supply of a service; or

c Any enactment which defines or restricts the rights, duties, or liabilities arising in connection with a service of any description; or

d Any rule of law or any enactment relating to contracts of employment or contracts of apprenticeship; or
