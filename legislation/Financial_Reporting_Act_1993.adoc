19A Interpretation for section 19

1 For the purposes of section 19,

a a person is ordinarily resident in New Zealand if that person

ii is living in New Zealand and the place where that person usually lives is, and has been for the immediately preceding 12 months, in New Zealand, whether or not that person has on occasions been away from New Zealand during that period:

b a company is large if at least 2 of the following subparagraphs apply:

i as at the balance date of the accounting period for which financial statements are required, the total assets (including intangible assets) of the company and its subsidiaries (if any) reported in the statement of financial position or consolidated statement of financial position (as the case may be) exceeds $10,000,000:

23 Membership of Board

1 The Board consists of no fewer than 4 and not more than 9 members.

4 In subsection (3), *company* includes an association of persons whether incorporated or not.

5 The Board may determine that

a a financial reporting standard that has not been issued so as to apply to a particular person (including a department or office of Parliament) or category of persons will apply to that person or category of persons in relation to the accounting periods or interim accounting periods that the Board may determine; or

a the Board is satisfied that it is desirable to allow this subsection to apply because bringing the financial reporting standard, amendment, or determination into effect earlier than is provided in subsection (1) is necessary or desirable in order for 1 or more reporting entities or the directors of those entities to comply with the financial reporting or accounting standards issued or adopted by an international organisation (for example, the International Accounting Standards Board); and

b the notice under section 31 states that this subsection applies; and

c the directors of the reporting entity elect in writing that this subsection should apply in respect of the financial reporting standard, amendment, or determination.

3 A financial reporting standard, an amendment to a financial reporting standard, or a determination made under section 27(5) commences to apply in relation to the accounting periods or interim accounting periods that the Board specifies in the standard, amendment, or determination, which periods

a may be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have commenced or that commence before the date on which the financial reporting standard, amendment, or determination takes effect; but

b must not be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have ended or that end before the financial reporting standard, amendment, or determination takes effect.

4 However, if a financial reporting standard specifies that an election may be made under this subsection, any of the following may elect in writing that the standard will apply to a particular accounting period or interim accounting period that it would not otherwise apply to:

3 An auditing and assurance standard or an amendment to an auditing and assurance standard takes effect on the 28th day after the date of the notification of the issue or amendment in the Gazette.

4 An auditing and assurance standard or an amendment to an auditing and assurance standard commences to apply in relation to the accounting periods or interim accounting periods that the Board specifies in the standard or amendment, which periods

a may be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have commenced or that commence before the date on which the auditing and assurance standard or amendment takes effect; but

b must not be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have ended or that end before the auditing and assurance standard or amendment takes effect.

30 Revocation of standard

1 The Board may revoke a specified standard.

2 Any revocation takes effect on the 28th day after the date of the notification of the revocation in the Gazette.

3 The revocation of a specified standard applies in relation to the accounting periods or interim accounting periods that the Board specifies, which periods

a may be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have commenced or that commence before the date on which the revocation takes effect; but

b must not be accounting periods or interim accounting periods that have ended or that end before the revocation takes effect.

4 However, if the revocation of a financial reporting standard specifies that an election may be made under this subsection, any of the following may elect in writing that the revocation will apply to a particular accounting period or interim accounting period that it would not otherwise apply to:

a the directors of a reporting entity:

b the Minister of Finance and the Secretary to the Treasury, in relation to financial statements for the Crown required to be prepared under the Public Finance Act 1989:

c the chief executive of a department:

d the chief executive of an office of Parliament:

e the chairperson and the chief executive of a Crown entity or, if no chairperson exists, the chief executive:

f the chief executive of a local authority.

34B Process for preparing strategy for tiers of financial reporting

1 In preparing the draft strategy under section 34A, the Board must have regard to
