5 Where any person is beneficially entitled to a deceased owner's beneficial interest in Maori freehold land, the vesting of that beneficial interest in that person shall not entitle that person to receive, in priority to any creditor of the deceased person, revenue from that beneficial interest.

6 When any person has died before the 1st day of April 1968 possessed of a freehold interest in Maori land that is subject to a contract of sale or to any lease or other alienation, the freehold interest of the deceased shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to include the deceased's interest in all purchase money, rent, and other money payable in respect of that alienation and not actually paid before the deceased's death, whether such money became due and payable before or after that death.

d Any valid assignment or charge of any money arising out of the alienation of Maori freehold land or any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land, or the revenue derived from that money, made in favour of a State Loan Department or of the Crown.

105 Duty payable on succession to Maori land

106 Special provisions relating to testamentary promises and family protection

a The term *child*, in relation to the person who made the will or any other person referred to in the will, or any term of the same meaning, shall, unless a contrary intention appears from the will, be construed as including any child of that person, whether legitimate or illegitimate, who is capable in accordance with tikanga Maori of taking Maori freehold land by way of intestate succession from that person:

b The term *heir*, or *next-of-kin*, or any similar term used in relation to the person who made the will with reference to any specific property, shall, unless it is expressly stated to the contrary in the will, be construed as referring to the person or persons who, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act, would be entitled to succeed to that property on the death of the person who made the will if that person had died intestate with respect to that property.

2 Where any term referred to in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section appears in a will of a Maori who died on or after the 1st day of April 1968 but before the 24th day of October 1969 (being the date of the commencement of subsections (1) to (3) of section 4 of the Maori Purposes Act 1969), that term shall be construed in the same manner as it would have been had the person who made the will not been Maori.

1 Subject to subsection (2) of this section, on the death intestate of the owner of any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land, the persons primarily entitled to succeed to that interest, and the proportions in which they are so entitled, shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions:

a Where the deceased leaves issue, the persons entitled shall be the child or children of the deceased living at his or her death, in equal portions if more than one, together with the issue living at the death of the deceased of any child of the deceased who died before the deceased, that issue to take through all degrees, according to their stocks, in equal portions if more than one, the portion to which their parent would have been entitled if living at the death of the deceased:

b Where the deceased leaves no issue, but leaves brothers and sisters, the persons entitled shall be the deceased's brothers and sisters living at the death of the deceased (including brothers and sisters of the half blood descended from the parent or other ascendant through whom the deceased received his or her entitlement to that interest), in equal portions if more than one, together with the issue living at the death of the deceased of any such brother or sister of the deceased who died before the deceased, that issue to take through all degrees, according to their stocks, in equal portions if more than one, the portion to which their parent would have been entitled if living at the death of the deceased:

c Where the deceased leaves no issue and no brothers and sisters, the persons entitled to succeed shall be ascertained always by reference to the derivation of entitlement by the deceased and shall be the issue, living at the deceased's death, of the person nearest in the chain of title to the deceased who has issue living at the deceased's death, that issue to take through all degrees, according to their stocks, in equal shares if more than one.

2 Where the owner of a beneficial interest in any Maori freehold land dies intestate leaving a person who is the owner's surviving spouse or civil union partner, that person is, subject to subsection (4), entitled as of right to an interest in that interest for life, or until he or she remarries or enters into a civil union or a de facto relationship.

3 Such a surviving spouse or civil union partner may, on the death of the deceased or at any time thereafter, surrender in writing his or her entitlement under subsection (2) of this section, whereupon the Court shall vest the interest absolutely in the persons entitled to succeed to the interest.

4 A surviving spouse or civil union partner shall not be entitled under subsection (2) of this section if, at the date of the death of the owner, a separation order, or a separation agreement made by deed or other writing, is in force in respect of the marriage or civil union between the surviving spouse or civil union partner and the owner.

109A Succession to ota whakanoho on intestacy

1 Subject to subsection (2), section 109 applies, with all necessary modifications, to an occupation order as if it were a beneficial interest in Maori freehold land.

2 A person is entitled to succeed to an occupation order

a if the person owns a beneficial interest in the land to which the occupation order applies; and

b if the Court is satisfied, in the circumstances, that the extent of the person's beneficial interest in the land justifies that person succeeding to the occupation order.

3 An occupation order that passes by succession is cancelled automatically on the date of expiry or termination of the occupation order.

110 Succession on intestacy to property other than Maori land

1 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, the persons entitled on the complete or partial intestacy of a Maori to succeed to that person's estate, so far as it comprises property that is not a beneficial interest in Maori freehold land, shall be determined in accordance with the law governing succession to the estates of persons who are not Maori.

2 The right of any person to succeed to any property in accordance with subsection (1) of this section shall not be affected by the fact that the claimant or any person through whom his or her claim is derived is or was illegitimate.

111 Interests in General land of deceased Maori

1 On application by the administrator of any Maori who has died possessed of any freehold interest in General land, the Court may make an order vesting that interest in the administrator or in the person entitled to succeed to the interest under the will or on the intestacy of the deceased.

2 For the purposes of an application under subsection (1) of this section, the Court may, without further inquiry, accept the certificate of the applicant that the person named in the certificate is entitled to succeed to the interest.

3 The making of a vesting order under this section shall not absolve the administrator from any liability incurred by the administrator in respect of his or her duties; and, for the purposes of determining any such liability, the making of the vesting order shall be regarded as if it had been a conveyance of the interest by the administrator to the person in whom the interest is vested by the Court.

112 Transmission of Maori land to administrator

1 On application by the administrator of any estate to which this Part of this Act applies, the Maori Land Court may make an order vesting any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land belonging to the estate in the administrator.

3 An order made by the Court under subsection (1) of this section may be registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952.

113 Maori Land Court to determine beneficial entitlements to Maori land

1 On an application by the administrator or by any person interested or by the Registrar, the Court shall determine the persons (in this section referred to as the beneficiaries) who are legally entitled to succeed to any beneficial freehold interest in Maori freehold land belonging to any estate to which this Part of this Act applies, and shall define the proportions of the several beneficiaries.

2 Every determination made for the purposes of this section shall be recorded in the minutes of the Court, but it shall not be necessary for the Court to draw up in writing any order with respect to its determination.

3 Where any freehold interest in land has been devised by will to a trustee other than a bare trustee, the trustee shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be the beneficiary.

4 In considering any application under this section, the Court may require such evidence as it thinks fit, but may, without further inquiry, accept the certificate of the administrator that the person named in the certificate is entitled to succeed to the interest to which the application relates.

5 Until the Court has made a determination under this section in respect of any beneficial freehold interest in Maori freehold land belonging to any estate, no vesting order may be made in respect of that interest under section 117 or section 118 of this Act.

6 The making of a determination under this section shall not absolve the executor or administrator from any liability incurred by the executor or administrator in respect of his or her duties.

114 Succession to Maori land on intestacy where no person primarily entitled

1 If, in respect of any estate to which this Part of this Act applies, the Court is of the opinion that no person is primarily entitled to succeed to any beneficial freehold interest in Maori freehold land in accordance with section 109 of this Act, it shall determine the persons entitled to succeed in accordance with tikanga Maori.

2 In any case where customary links with the land have been severed or cannot for any reason be ascertained, the Court may determine who is entitled to succeed by taking into account tikanga Maori applicable to the situation, and, in doing so, the Court may consider

a The means by which the interest was acquired; and

b The origin and nature of the interest; and

c The persons entitled to succeed to any other interest owned by the deceased at his or her death, and the nature of that interest; and

d The nature of any other property owned by the deceased at his or her death.

3 If, in any case, the Court is of the opinion that no person is entitled to succeed in accordance with section 109 of this Act or with tikanga Maori, it may, by order, vest the interest or shares

a In the trustees of a putea trust constituted under section 212 of this Act; or

b In the other owners.

115 Court may make provision for whangai

1 In the exercise of its powers under this Part of this Act in respect of any estate, the Court may determine whether a person is or is not to be recognised for the purposes of this Part as having been a whangai of the deceased owner.

2 Where, in any such case, the Court determines that a person is to be recognised for the purposes of this Part as having been a whangai of the deceased owner, it may make either or both of the following orders:

a An order that the whangai shall be entitled to succeed to any beneficial interest in any Maori freehold land belonging to the estate to the same extent, or to any specified lesser extent, as that person would have been so entitled if that person had been the child of the deceased owner:

b An order that the whangai shall not be entitled to succeed, or shall be entitled to succeed only to a specified lesser extent, to any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land to, or than that, which that person would otherwise be entitled to succeed on the death of that person's parents or either of them.

3 Every order under subsection (2) of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything in section 19 of the Adoption Act 1955.

116 Court may make special provision relating to income

1 Subject to subsection (2) of this section, in the exercise of its powers under this Part of this Act in respect of any estate, the Court may make an order conferring on any person the right to the whole or any part of the income derived from any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land, or to the whole or any part of the proceeds of sale of any such interest, belonging to the estate, for life or for any shorter period.

2 The Court shall not make an order under this section in favour of any person whose claim, in the opinion of the Court, fell or falls within the jurisdiction of the High Court under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955.

3 In enacting this provision, Parliament has in mind particularly the possibility of injustice arising in individual cases from the prohibitions enacted by this Act against the alienation of beneficial interests in Maori freehold land to persons outside defined classes, and is therefore desirous of conferring on the Court some flexible, if limited, powers to ameliorate any such injustice.

117 Vesting in persons beneficially entitled following grant of administration

1 Subject to section 119 of this Act, where administration of any estate to which this Part of this Act applies has been granted, the Court may, on the application of the administrator or of any person interested, make an order vesting any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land belonging to the estate in the persons (in this section referred to as the beneficiaries) who are legally entitled to succeed to the interest.

2 An administrator may make an application under this section notwithstanding that the interest to which it relates has not been vested in the administrator under section 112 of this Act.

3 In disposing of any interest of a deceased owner under this section, the Court may exercise all or any of the following powers:

a The Court may exercise with respect to the whole or any part of the interest any jurisdiction that it would have had authority to exercise under any of the provisions of this Act, if application had been duly made in accordance with this Act and with the rules of Court:

b The Court may, with the consent of a beneficiary, vest the whole or any part of the interest of that beneficiary in any other person who is entitled to acquire or succeed to that interest:

c The Court may give effect to any arrangement or agreement whereby the interest of any beneficiary is to be vested in any other beneficiary or in any other person who is entitled to acquire or succeed to that interest, but no person shall be excluded from any interest to which that person is entitled without that person's consent.

4 For the purposes of subsection (3)(c) of this section, any agreement or arrangement may, in the case of a person under disability, be entered into or made on behalf of that person by a trustee appointed under Part 12 of this Act, or, if no such trustee is appointed, by any other responsible person.

5 Where any beneficial freehold interest in land has been devised by the will of the deceased owner to a trustee other than a bare trustee, the trustee shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be the beneficiary.

6 In any case to which subsection (5) of this section applies, the existence of the trust shall be stated on the face of the relevant vesting order.

7 Nothing in this section shall limit or affect any right or remedy to which any person may be entitled in respect of any act done by any other person as administrator of any estate.

8 Any money held by the Maori Trustee or any other agent for any person at the date of that person's death, being the proceeds of the alienation of any Maori freehold land, shall be deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(c) of this section to be interests in Maori freehold land; and the Court may dispose of that money accordingly by making an order for payment of it under section 242 of this Act.

9 Nothing in subsection (8) of this section shall impose any liability on the Maori Trustee or other agent in respect of any payment out of the proceeds of sale after the death of the deceased if the payment was made by the Maori Trustee or other agent without knowledge of the owner's death.

118 Vesting in persons beneficially entitled where no grant of administration

1 Subject to section 119 of this Act, where

a Administration of any estate to which this Part of this Act applies has not been granted; or

b The administrator of any estate to which this Part of this Act applies has died after a grant of administration has been made,the Court may make an order vesting any beneficial interest in Maori freehold land belonging to the estate in the persons entitled to the interest.

2 An application for an order under this section shall be made by or on behalf of the person or one of the persons claiming to be entitled to the interest under the will or on the intestacy of the deceased person.

3 No order shall be made under this section unless the Court is satisfied

a That the person or persons entitled to obtain a grant of administration of the estate of the deceased person does not or do not intend to seek any such grant; and

b That there is no apparent reason why the estate of the deceased person should be formally administered.

4 In making an order under this section, the Court shall proceed as if all the persons living at the death of the deceased person who, if they had then attained full age, would have taken an absolutely vested interest in any part of the estate, had then attained full age.

5 The provisions of subsections (2) to (9) of section 117 of this Act, with any necessary modifications, shall apply to the exercise of the Court's powers under this section.

6 Where the known estate of a deceased person has previously been administered and additional interests of the deceased in Maori freehold land are discovered, the Court, notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, may deal with those interests under this section if it is satisfied that any other course would be unduly expensive or difficult having regard to the value of the interests.

118A Circumstances when certain assets and payments must be held in trust

1 If the Court makes an order under section 26M(1)(f)(iii) or (2) that an action be prevented or be subject to an interim injunction, as the case may be,

a Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited must hold the assets that are subject to the order in trust for that mandated iwi organisation until

2 In this section, *mandated iwi organisation* and *Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited* have the meaning set out in section 26A.

118B Circumstances when certain transfers and payments must be held in trust

1 If the Court makes an order under section 26ZA(1)(f)(iii) or (2) that an action be prevented or be subject to an interim injunction, as the case may be,

i the date specified in the order; or

2 Upon the making of a vesting order under this Part of this Act in respect of any interest to which this section applies, the Court shall determine the value of the interest as at the date of the owner's death, and the value so determined shall be final and conclusive for the purposes of this section.

3 Where the value of the interest is not less than $2,000, there shall be payable in respect of the order, in addition to any fee prescribed by regulations made under this Act, a special succession fee equal to 2 percent of the value of the interest; but in no case shall the amount of the succession fee exceed the amount by which the value of the interest exceeds $2,000.

5 Nothing in subsection (1) of this section requires the Registrar to record the ownership of beneficial interests in land that, by virtue of this Act, remain vested in the several owners of that land despite the vesting of the legal estate in fee simple in that land in a Maori incorporation.

128 Court may issue declaratory consolidated order

1 This section applies to any case where any instrument of title (whether or not registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952) issued with respect to any Maori freehold land does not fully disclose the names of the several persons for the time being entitled to any estate or interest in that land and the several shares and interests to which they are so entitled as a result of changes of ownership effected or evidenced by subsequent orders of the Court or of a Registrar, or certificates or other documents recorded in the records of the Court or in the Land Transfer Office.

2 In any case to which this section applies, the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, make a consolidated order declaring, as at the date of the order, the names of the persons who, by virtue of the instrument of title or the subsequent orders, certificates, or other documents referred to in subsection (1) of this section, are then entitled to any estate or interest in the land and the several shares and interests to which they are so entitled.

3 Where a beneficial owner named in the original instrument of title or in any subsequent order has died, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, and in respect of the beneficial interest of that owner a succession order has been made under any former Act or a vesting order has been made under section 136 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953 or under section 117 or section 118 of this Act, vesting the interest of the deceased owner in a trustee pursuant to the will of the deceased, the trustee shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of that interest for the purposes of the consolidated order, and the existence of the trust shall be disclosed in the order by reference to the will of the deceased owner.

4 The consolidated order shall be made to incorporate the effect of any order affecting the ownership of any interest made by the Court subsequent to the drawing up of the draft consolidated order.

10 Representation of owners of Maori land

180 Purpose of this Part
The principal purpose of this Part of this Act is to provide for more effective and direct representation of the owners of Maori land in multiple ownership.

181 Notice to owners of Maori land may be given to Registrar in certain cases

1 This section applies to Maori freehold land beneficially owned by more than 10 persons and not vested in any trustee or trustees.

2 Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, the Registrar may, on any application made to the Registrar, certify that this section shall apply to any Maori land beneficially owned by not more than 10 persons and not vested in any trustee or trustees where the Registrar is satisfied that, because any owner is dead and that owner's interests have not been vested in successors, or because the whereabouts of any owner is unknown, the giving of notice to, and the representation of, the owners in the ordinary way is impractical; and where the Registrar gives such a certificate in respect of any land, this section shall apply to that land accordingly.

3 Where it is required, under any Act, bylaw, or other enactment, that notice be given to the owners of land and no express provision is made in that enactment relating to the manner in which such notice is to be given in the case of Maori land, notice may be given to the owners of any land to which this section applies by serving it on the Registrar of the Maori Land Court for the district in which the land is situated.

a Not begin to run until the Court has appointed an agent to represent the owners under section 183 of this Act or, where no agent is appointed, until the date of the Court's decision under that section; and

3 The Court shall not direct the summoning of a meeting of owners if it is satisfied

a That the matter is of such urgency that it must be dealt with and completed before a meeting could be held; or

b That

i The matter does not involve any possibility of the land or any part of the land, or any interest in or over the land, being alienated, granted, or charged in any way; and

ii The matter is of insufficient importance to warrant the expense and inconvenience involved in calling a meeting of owners; and

iii The interests of the owners can be protected adequately by an agent or agents appointed under section 183 of this Act.

183 Court may appoint agent of owners for purposes of notices, etc

1 This section applies to any land to which section 181 of this Act applies.

2 Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, the Court may, on application made to it, certify that this section shall apply to any Maori land beneficially owned by not more than 10 persons and not vested in any trustee or trustees where it is satisfied that, because any owner is dead and that owner's interests have not been vested in successors, or because the whereabouts of any owner is unknown, the giving of notice to, and the representation of, the owners in the ordinary way is impractical; and where the Court gives such a certificate in respect of any land, this section shall apply to that land accordingly.

5 The Court shall not appoint any individual or body to be an agent of the owners under this section unless it is satisfied

a That the individual or body has sufficient ability, experience, and knowledge to carry out the duties involved satisfactorily; and

b That the appointment of that individual or body would be broadly acceptable to the owners; and

c That the individual or body consents to the appointment.

6 An agent may be appointed for any one or more of the following purposes:

c Subsection (6) of that section did not require the Registrar of the Court to give to the Maori Trustee notice of the filing by the lessee of any objection to that valuation but required instead that the Registrar of the Court give to those trustees or that Maori incorporation, as the case may require, notice of the filing by the lessee of any such objection.

a Nominate a registered valuer to conduct a valuation for the purposes of this section; and

b Notify the lessee in writing of the name of the valuer.

2A If the lessee does not object to the registered valuer within 14 days after being notified of the nomination, that valuer may conduct the valuation.

2B If the lessee does object within 14 days after the notification, and no agreement as to who should conduct the valuation can be reached, the valuation is to be conducted by a registered valuer nominated by the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers.

3 A person who requests a valuation for the purposes of this section must supply to the registered valuer either an original or counterpart copy of the lease, or a copy verified by statutory declaration as being a true copy of the clauses of the lease relating to the revision of the rent, or the renewal of the lease, as the case may require, the area of the land, the term of the lease, the original rent, and any record contained in the lease identifying improvements existing on the land at the commencement of the lease and in respect of which no capital payment has been made by the lessee at the commencement of the lease.

4 Where the lease provides that improvements effected by the lessee during the term of the lease or any class of any such improvements shall not be taken into account for the purpose of revising the rent or renewing the lease, as the case may require, the value of any such improvements shall be shown separately in the valuation made for the purposes of this section.

5 Subsections (2) to (7) of section 207 and section 208 of this Act shall, as far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, apply to valuations made for the purpose of this section.

i There shall, when that objection has been finally determined, be an accounting between the parties as to any shortfall or excess in the rent already paid; and

ii The Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent may retain so much of the rent paid to the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent, without distributing it to the beneficiaries, as the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent considers necessary to ensure that the accounting required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph to take place between the parties can occur on the final determination of the objection.

Where any Maori freehold land or General land owned by Maori is held under 2 or more separate titles but relates to the same lease, the rent received in respect of that land shall be apportioned to the separate areas in such manner as may be fixed by the lease or, where the proportions are not fixed by the lease, in such manner as the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent considers equitable.

2 All money payable to a lessee as compensation for improvements under any lease referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall constitute a charge upon the land comprised in the lease, and when the compensation becomes payable in accordance with the provisions of the lease, the charge may be enforced by the Court by the appointment of a receiver.

3 Every such charge shall cease and determine on the expiration of 6 months after the date when the compensation becomes payable unless the lessee, before the expiration of the said period of 6 months or within such extended time as the Court may allow pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, has taken all necessary steps required of the lessee to have the amount of compensation determined in the manner provided by the lease, and has applied to the Court for the appointment of a receiver for the enforcement of the charge.

b Under Part 2 of the Maori Affairs Restructuring Act 1989 or any corresponding former enactment,except so far as they are expressly incorporated in or applied by the lease.

207 Compensation to be ascertained by valuation

1 For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of compensation to which the lessee under any lease to which this section applies is entitled in accordance with the terms of the lease and this Part, the Maori Trustee, the lessor, or a person acting on behalf of the lessor must, whether of their own motion or at the request of the lessee,

a Nominate a registered valuer to make a valuation of the land comprised in the lease as at the date of the termination of the lease, or as at such other date as the lease provides; and

b Notify the lessee in writing of the name of the registered valuer.

1A If the lessee does not object to the registered valuer within 14 days after being notified of the nomination, that valuer may conduct the valuation.

1B If the lessee does object within 14 days after the notification, and no agreement as to who should conduct the valuation can be reached, the valuation is to be conducted by a registered valuer nominated by the President of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers.

2 On the completion of a special valuation under this section, the registered valuer shall cause to be prepared a certificate setting forth the following particulars:

a The name of the lessee:

b The area of the land comprised in the lease, and the name by which the land is commonly known or other description of the land sufficient to identify it:

c A list of the improvements and the value of those improvements either separately or in classes:

d The unimproved value of the land:

e The capital value of the land.

3 For the purposes of this section, the expressions *capital value* and *value of improvements* shall have the meanings given to them respectively by the Valuation of Land Act 1951 (as in force before its repeal by section 53 of the Rating Valuations Act 1998), and, subject to subsections (5) and (6) of this section, every valuation made under this section shall be made in the same manner as if it were a valuation under that Act.

4 Notwithstanding that the meaning of the expressions *capital value* and *value of improvements* or either of them may be amended during the currency of any lease, those expressions shall, for the purposes of valuations to be made under this section in respect of that lease, continue to have the meanings assigned to them by the Valuation of Land Act 1951 as at the commencement of the lease.

5 For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the Valuation of Land Act 1951 shall be read as if, for the definition of the term improvements set out in section 2 of that Act, there were substituted the following definition:

*Improvements* means all work done or material used at any time on the land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land so far as the effect of the work done or material used is to increase the value of the land, and the benefit thereof is unexhausted at the time of valuationProvided that the reclamation of land from the sea shall not in any case be deemed to be improvements either of the land reclaimed or of any other land:Provided also that work done or material used on or for the benefit of any land by the expenditure of capital or labour by any owner or occupier of the land in the provision of roads or in the provision of water, drainage, or other amenities in connection with the subdivision of the land for building purposes shall not, after the land has been sold or another person has taken actual occupation of the land (whether by virtue of a tenancy for not less than 6 months or not), be deemed to be improvements on that land.

6 For the purposes of any determination by a registered valuer under this section, the term *unimproved value*, in relation to any land, means the sum that the owner's estate or interest in the land, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge, might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bone fide seller might be expected to impose, and if no improvements had been made on the land.

7 Every certificate given by a registered valuer for the purposes of this section shall have attached to it, or written or printed on it in prominent characters, a notice to the effect that the valuation to which the certificate relates is subject to objection in the manner prescribed by, and within the time limited in accordance with, section 208 of this Act.

208 Notice of valuation and right of objection

1 As soon as practicable after making any special valuation under section 207 of this Act, the registered valuer shall serve not less than 2 copies of the certificate on the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent.

2 The Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent shall serve a copy of the certificate on the lessee and on the owner or owners, together in each case with a notice that objections to the valuation to which the certificate relates may be lodged in the manner and within the time specified in the notice.

3 Every notice given under subsection (2) of this section shall state the date before which objections to the valuation may be made, being in each case a period not less than 2 months after the date of service, and shall specify the office of the District Court in which objections shall be filed.

4 If the lessee or any owner objects to any of the values as appearing in the certificate, the lessee or owner may, within the time specified in that behalf in the notice given under subsection (2) of this section, file an objection to the valuation in the appropriate office of the District Court.

5 Every objection shall specify the several items to which the objection relates, and with respect to each item shall specify the grounds of the objection.

6 On the filing of any such objection, the Registrar of the Court shall forthwith give to the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent and to the registered valuer notice of the filing of the objection and of the terms of it, and, where the objection is filed by or on behalf of the owners, shall give a like notice to the lessee.

7 For the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section, the expression *the appropriate office of the District Court* has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Land Valuation Proceedings Act 1948.

8 All objections made in the manner prescribed by this section are to be heard and determined in similar manner to objections made to valuations under the Rating Valuations Act 1998, and sections 34, 35, 36, and 38 of that Act (and any regulations made under that Act relating to reviews and objections), as far as they are applicable and with all necessary modifications, are to apply to the objection as if

a The registered valuer had been appointed by a territorial authority to review the objection; and

b The review had been made under section 34 of that Act; and

c The references to a territorial authority in sections 34(4), 35, and 36 of that Act were references to the registered valuer.

9 If, on the hearing of any objection, any alteration in the valuation is made, the registered valuer shall amend the certificate of valuation accordingly.

209 Record of improvements, etc

1 Any lease providing for the payment of compensation for improvements effected by the lessee may stipulate that a record of the state and condition of the land and of any improvements existing on it as at the commencement of the lease, and a valuation of the land, shall be made in accordance with this section.

2 On the request of any party to any such lease made within 2 months after the grant of the lease, the Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent shall cause to be made, in such manner as he or she thinks fit, the record referred to in subsection (1) of this section, and a valuation under subsection (3) of this section.

3 The Maori Trustee or the Court appointed agent may request a registered valuer to make a special valuation of the land comprised in the lease as at the date of the commencement of the lease, and the provisions of sections 207 and 208, as far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, apply to any such valuation.

4 The cost of making any such record and valuation shall be deemed to be an expense properly deductible, by instalments or otherwise, from any rent received from the lease of the land in respect of which the record is made.

5 Where the lessee under a farm lease makes, or proposes to make, any improvements in respect of which the lessee will be entitled to compensation, the lessee shall be entitled, on application to the Maori Trustee, to have a record made by the Maori Trustee of particulars of the nature of those improvements and of the state and condition of the land before the making of the improvements.

6 Every such record shall be made at the cost in all things of the lessee.

7 Every record made under this section shall be retained by the Maori Trustee, and shall at all times be receivable as sufficient evidence of the facts so recorded in all matters and proceedings relating to the value of the improvements effected by the lessee.

261 Equitable interests not to be separately dealt with

1 The alienation, whether by operation of law or otherwise, of the shares of any shareholder in a Maori incorporation shall, whether so expressed or not in any instrument of alienation or vesting order, be deemed to be an alienation of that shareholder's equitable interest in the land and other assets for the time being vested in the incorporation.

267 Unclaimed dividends

1 In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,

*Dividends* means money payable to any shareholder of a Maori incorporation by way of dividend; and includes any money that is, by this Part of this Act, required to be treated as an amount payable to a shareholder by way of dividend; and also includes any money that, pursuant to section 15A(6) of the Maori Reserved Land Act 1955, has been paid to the incorporation by the Maori Trustee on behalf of an individual beneficial owner to whom it has been allocated

*Unclaimed dividends* means dividends in the hands of an incorporation that have been held by it or by a preceding incorporation or body corporate (including the Maori Trustee) for at least 10 years without payment to the shareholder or other person entitled.

2 Every Maori incorporation holding dividends that, at any time after the commencement of this Act, become unclaimed dividends, shall, within 12 months after the dividends have become unclaimed dividends, compile a list of the shareholders to whom those dividends are payable, setting out the amount of unclaimed dividends held for each shareholder, and shall transmit the list to the Registrar of the Maori Land Court District who maintains, under section 279 of this Act, the Register of Maori Incorporations in which particulars of that Maori incorporation are included.

3 The Registrar of the Maori Land Court District shall include the list transmitted to that Registrar under subsection (2) of this section in the Register of Maori Incorporations in such a manner as to show, in relation to the Maori incorporation by which the list was transmitted, the particulars contained in that list.

4 Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) of this section, it shall not be necessary to include in any such list the name of any shareholder that has been included in any previous list of unclaimed dividends.

5 If, within 12 months after the date of the inclusion in the Register of Maori Incorporations of a list of unclaimed dividends, no claim has been established in respect of the dividends shown in the list as payable to any shareholder, the committee of management may authorise the transfer of those dividends (together with any other dividends held for the same shareholder) to the incorporation absolutely; and, subject to subsection (6) of this section, those dividends shall thereupon become the absolute property of the incorporation, freed of all interests of the shareholder, and may be applied as if they were revenues derived from its operation by the incorporation; and the books of account of the incorporation shall be amended accordingly.

6 If, at any time after the expiry of the said period of 12 months, a claim in respect of any unclaimed dividends is lawfully established by the shareholder or by any person claiming through the shareholder, the amount of the claim shall be payable by the incorporation as a debt due to the claimant accordingly.

7 If any unclaimed dividends held for a shareholder have been dealt with in the manner provided by subsection (5) of this section and have become the property of the incorporation, any future dividends payable to that shareholder may be similarly dealt with without the necessity of inclusion in a further list of unclaimed dividends, and the provisions of that subsection shall apply accordingly.

b Into parcels held by 2 or more owners as joint tenants:

c Into parcels held by any number of owners as tenants in common together with owners holding as joint tenants:

d Into parcels held by 2 or more owners as tenants in common.

2 Nothing in this Part of this Act shall prevent any such owner from retaining any interest in the residue of the land.

291 Discretionary powers of Court in making partitions

1 In partitioning any land under this Part of this Act, the Court may exercise its discretionary powers in accordance with the following provisions of this section:

a It may partition the land among the several owners in accordance, as nearly as may be, with their several shares; or

b In order to give effect to any agreement or arrangement made by the owners concerned, it may allot the share or any of the shares of any owner to any other owner, subject to such conditions as to payment of compensation or otherwise as may have been agreed to.

2 Nothing in subsection (1)(a) of this section shall limit the powers conferred on the Court by section 293 of this Act, or to prevent the Court from varying the shares of the several owners with their consent, or otherwise from varying their shares within reasonable limits if, in its opinion, a variation is necessary to enable the Court to make an equitable partition.

3 The Court shall make vesting orders for the purpose of giving effect to any arrangement made for the purpose of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

4 When any compensation is made payable by any person under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the Court may, in the partition order or by a separate charging order, constitute the compensation a charge on any land or interest in land owned by the person by whom the compensation is payable.

292 Allotment of interests on partition

1 Where, by reason of the smallness of the undivided shares, or for any other reason, the Court is of the opinion that it would be inequitable to partition any area in strict accordance with the respective shares of the owners, the Court may, in partitioning that area, allot to any owner a parcel or interest greater in value than that to which the owner would otherwise be entitled, and may allot to any other owner a parcel or interest proportionately less in value than that to which the owner would otherwise be entitled.

2 The excess in the value of the parcel or interest allotted by the Court shall be determined by the Court and shall be stated in the partition order, and shall be expressly constituted by that order a charge upon the parcel or interest bearing that excess in value in favour of the person who has received a corresponding deficiency in value, or in favour of a trustee for that person.

293 Power to award additional land as compensation for improvements, etc

1 Where, in any proceedings for the partition of any area of Maori freehold land, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that any owner of an undivided interest in the land

a Has paid any survey charge or rates due in respect of the land; or

b Has effected improvements on the land; or

c Has expended money for any purpose that, in the opinion of the Court, is for the benefit of all the owners of the land,the Court, on partitioning the land, may award to that owner such an area, in addition to the area to which that owner would otherwise be entitled, as in its opinion would be adequate to recompense that owner for the money so paid or expended or the improvements so effected by that owner.

2 Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, instead of awarding additional land to any owner in accordance with that subsection, the Court may, in the partition order or in any subsequent order, make an order for the award of compensation in respect of any such payments made, expenditure incurred, or improvements effected by the owner, and by the order shall determine by whom and the proportions in which any such compensation shall be payable.

3 When any compensation is awarded under this section, the Court, by the same or any subsequent order, may constitute any such compensation a charge on any land or interest in land owned by the person by whom the compensation is payable.

294 Saving of interests charged on partitioned land
If, on the partition of any land, the share or interest of any person in the land is subject to any right, charge, or interest vested in any other person, that right, charge, or interest shall, subject to any apportionment or adjustment made under section 292 of this Act, attach to and affect the land or interest that is allocated by the partition order to the owner of the first-mentioned share or interest.

295 Court may apportion rights and obligations

1 When a partition order is made, the Court may, in that order or in any subsequent order made on the application of any person interested, or of its own motion, apportion or adjust, as between the several parcels into which the land has been partitioned, all rights, obligations, or liabilities arising from any lease, licence, mortgage, or charge to which the land is subject at the date of the partition.

2 Every such order of apportionment or adjustment shall have effect according to its tenor in the same manner in all respects as if all necessary transfers, releases, convenants, and other dispositions or agreements had been duly made in that behalf by all persons concerned, and may be registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 accordingly.

3 Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the Court may exercise its powers of apportionment or adjustment under this section in such manner as it thinks equitable.

4 In the exercise of its powers under this section with respect to any mortgage or lease, the Court shall not make any apportionment or adjustment of rights, obligations, or liabilities without the consent of the mortgagee or lessee.

296 Dwelling sites for Maori

1 Without limiting the generality of the powers and discretions conferred on the Court by the preceding provisions of this Part of this Act, but subject to section 148 of this Act, the Court may partition any Maori freehold land, on the application of any owner, for the purpose of providing that owner with a site for a dwelling.

2 The Court shall make a vesting order for the purpose of giving effect to any such partition.

3 An order may be made under this section vesting any land or interest in land in a husband and wife or civil union partners or de facto partners, as joint tenants or as tenants in common in equal shares, if the parties or either of the parties to the marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship is a person to whom the land or interest in land may be alienated in accordance with the provisions of Part 7 of this Act.

4 Where the Court has made an order under this section, or under section 440 of the Maori Affairs Act 1953, and after the expiry of 5 years after the date of the order, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the land has not been used as a site for a dwelling, the Court may, with the consent of any mortgagee or other encumbrancer, make an order cancelling the vesting order unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the failure to use the land as a site for a dwelling was due to circumstances over which the person in whom the land was vested had no control, or that for any other reason that person should not be deprived of the title to that land.

5 On cancelling a vesting order under subsection (4), the Court may order

a that the land be held again under the former instrument of title as if the vesting order had not been made; or

b that the land is vested in any other person whom the Court considers to be justly entitled to it.

6 If an order under subsection (5)(a) is made, all orders of the Court and all alienations affecting interests in the land made or effected since the date of the order cancelled are to be treated as relating to the former title and the interests under it.

7 On cancelling a vesting order under subsection (4), the Court may, if it considers it necessary, make an order under section 128.

297 Partition orders may be made in respect of land held in trust

1 Any Maori freehold land may be partitioned by the Court, whether it is owned at law by the beneficial owners of it, or is vested in trust for them or any of them in the Maori Trustee or in any other person; but, where the land is so held in trust, a partition shall affect only the equitable estate of the beneficiaries.

2 For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, no land shall be deemed to be held in trust for the owners or any of them merely because any person named in the partition order holds an interest as trustee under the terms of a will.

298 Partition of combined areas

1 Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, any area of land owned or partly owned by Maori (whether Maori land or General land), and any other area or areas of land, may, for the purposes of partition, be treated by the Court as a single area of land owned in common by the owners of the several areas, and the Court may make an order or orders of partition in respect of the areas.

2 No General land, other than General land owned by Maori, shall be dealt with under this section except with the consent in writing of the owner or owners and of every other person having a legal or equitable estate or interest in the land.

3 No Crown land shall be so dealt with without the consent of the Minister of the Crown having responsibility for the matter.

4 Where, by a partition order under this section, any General land is acquired by a Maori in severalty or in common with any other person or persons (whether or not Maori), it shall, unless otherwise specified in the order, become Maori freehold land.

5 For the purpose of giving effect to any order of partition under this section, the Court may cancel or vary any existing partition order or other order, although that order has already been registered or provisionally registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952.

6 The provisions of section 88 of this Act shall apply with respect to the cancellation or variation of any partition order or other order under this section, and to any consequential amendments required to be made in the register by the District Land Registrar.

299 Registration of partition orders

1 When a partition order affects land that is subject to the Land Transfer Act 1952, the following provisions shall apply in respect of the registration of the order under that Act:

a The Registrar of the Court shall forward the order to the District Land Registrar:

b If, when the order is received by the District Land Registrar, the title to the land so partitioned is already on the register as finally constituted under that Act, the order shall be registered against the title in accordance with that Act:

c If, when the order is received by the District Land Registrar, the title to the land partitioned is on the provisional register, the order may either be registered against the title in accordance with that Act or embodied in the provisional register as a separate folio of it; in which latter case

i It shall be numbered accordingly, and when so numbered shall, as provided in section 50 of the Land Transfer Act 1952, be deemed duly registered; and

ii The original folium relating to the land partitioned shall thereupon be cancelled so far as it relates to the parcel or any parcel included in the partition order; and

iii All entries and memorials affecting the title to any such parcel shall be transferred to the folium so constituted:

d If, when the order is received by the District Land Registrar, the title to the land partitioned has not been registered either finally or provisionally, the partition order shall be embodied in the provisional register, and shall form a separate folium of it, and shall be numbered accordingly, and when so numbered shall be deemed duly registered:

e All the provisions of the Land Transfer Act 1952 as to provisional registration shall, subject to this Act and as far as they are applicable, apply to provisional registration under this section:

f The District Land Registrar may retain on the provisional register any title that has been entered on it under this section, so long as the number of owners exceeds 10.

2 The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall, as far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, extend and apply to any partition order that affects the legal title to any land that is not subject to the Land Transfer Act 1952.

3 For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a partition order shall be deemed to affect the legal title to land notwithstanding that any other person named in the order is so named as a trustee under the terms of a will.

4

1 Notwithstanding anything in section 301 of this Act or in the Resource Management Act 1991, where the Court partitions any land to which section 301 of this Act applies, any condition imposed by the Court and requiring a contribution of land for reserve purposes or land in lieu of reserves shall only require any such land to be set aside from that part of the land that is to be alienated.

2 Notwithstanding anything in section 301 of this Act or in the Resource Management Act 1991, in relation to any partition of land to which section 301 of this Act applies,

b the Registrar-General of Land and Registrar of Deeds must not require, under Part 10 of the Resource Management Act 1991, the deposit of a survey plan for the partition.

3 

303 Subdivision consent and conditions of subdivision consent

1 Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Court may make a partition order to which section 301 of this Act applies in respect of any land if a subdivision consent under the Resource Management Act 1991 has been obtained for the partition and the consent has not lapsed.

2 The Court must

a make such orders as it considers necessary, having regard to Part 10 of the Resource Management Act 1991, to ensure that, in respect of any conditions of the subdivision consent that have not been complied with, adequate provision is made for such compliance; and

b have regard to sections 229 to 237H of the Resource Management Act 1991 in respect of every partition of land to which section 301 applies.

4 Land to which subsection (3) applies must be treated

a as if it were land set apart under section 338(1) and section 340(1); and

b As if the procedural requirements of those subsections had been satisfied.

5 The Court may declare that any land set apart under subsection (3) be dedicated for the construction of roads, if the Court considers that to be necessary to satisfy a condition or requirement of a subdivision consent.

6 No vesting order shall be made under this section in respect of any land which is subject to any lease, licence, mortgage, charge, or other encumbrance.

7 Where any land proposed to be dedicated or set apart under this section is subject to any lease, licence, mortgage, charge, or other encumbrance, the Court, with the consent of the person entitled to the benefit of the encumbrance and the vesting order, shall vest the land free from that encumbrance accordingly.

9 On the completion of any vesting order made by the Court for the purposes of this section, the Registrar must forward the order to the Registrar-General of Land who must register the order.

304 Power to impose restrictions in respect of other partitions

1 This section applies to every partition by the Court of Maori freehold land where the partition is into parcels to be held by owners who are members of the same hapu.

2 The Court shall, in respect of every partition to which this section applies, impose a restriction that the land shall not be sold under this Act otherwise than in accordance with this section.

3 If an application is made to the Court to confirm a sale of Maori land to which this section applies, to persons who are not members of the same hapu, the Court

a may, if it considers it appropriate, publicly notify the application and invite submissions from the territorial authority and any other person who is likely to be affected by the application; and

b may confirm or refuse to confirm the sale under section 152, having regard to sections 229 to 237H of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the fact that the land has previously been partitioned without a subdivision consent being obtained under that Act.

4 If an application involves the sale of land to persons who are not members of the same hapu, and the Court decides under subsection (3) that land is required to be set apart, reserved, or vested in another person, the Court must set that land apart as a Maori reservation, for the common use and benefit of the people of New Zealand, despite anything in the Resource Management Act 1991.

3 Where the whole of the land comprised in any partition order is subject to any lease, licence, mortgage, charge, or other encumbrance, the order shall not be cancelled under this section without the consent of the lessee, licensee, mortgagee, or other person entitled to the benefit of the encumbrance, unless the Court is satisfied that the rights and interests of that person would not be detrimentally affected by the cancellation of the order.

4 Upon the cancellation under this section of any partition order, the land comprised therein shall, to the extent of the cancellation, be held again under the former instrument of title as if no partition had taken place; and all orders of the Court and all alienations affecting interests in the land made or affected since the date of the order cancelled shall be deemed to relate to the former title and the interests under it.

5 Upon the cancellation under this section of a partition order, the Court shall, unless it considers such a course unnecessary, issue a declaratory order under section 128 of this Act declaring the current ownership of the land; and in such a case all the provisions of that section shall apply to the making of any such order, except that no notice of the order under subsection (3) of that section shall be necessary.



307 Amalgamation orders

1 Where the Court is satisfied that any land to which this Part of this Act applies, and that comprises 2 or more areas held under separate titles, can be more conveniently worked or dealt with as if it were held in common ownership under one title, the Court may cancel the several titles under which the land is held and make an amalgamation order substituting for those titles one title for the whole of the land.

2 An amalgamation order shall not be made in respect of any land that is for the time being subject to Part 2 of the Maori Affairs Restructuring Act 1989 without the consent of the Chief Executive.

3 Where the whole of the land comprised in any separate title is subject to any lease, licence, mortgage, charge, or other encumbrance, the Court shall not make an amalgamation order without the consent of the lessee, licensee, mortgagee, or other person entitled to the benefit of the encumbrance, unless it is satisfied that the rights and interests of that person would not be detrimentally affected by the making of the order.

4 Where an order is made in respect of land subject to any lease, licence, mortgage, or other encumbrance, the Court may make such order as it thinks proper for the apportionment or adjustment of the rights and obligations of any person under any such lease, licence, mortgage, or other encumbrance; and every order of apportionment or adjustment shall have effect according to its tenor in the same manner in all respects as if all necessary transfers, releases, covenants, and other dispositions or agreements had been duly made in that behalf by all persons concerned, and may be registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 accordingly.

5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 41 of this Act, an amalgamation order may be made to take effect on a date specified by the Court, which may be a date earlier or later than the date of the minute of the order entered in the records of the Court.

6 Subject to subsection (7) of this section, every amalgamation order shall, upon registration under the Land Transfer Act 1952, constitute the title to the land included in it, without any transfer or other instrument of assurance.

7 Where the land is vested in trust for the owners in the Maori Trustee or any other person, the order shall affect only the equitable estate of the beneficial owners.

8 An amalgamation order shall state upon its face the status of the land comprised in it as from the making of the order, in accordance with the following provisions:

a If any part of the land was formerly Maori freehold land, the whole of the land comprised in the order shall be Maori freehold land:

b If no part of the land was Maori freehold land, but part was General land, the whole of the land comprised in the order shall be General land:

c In any other case, the whole of the land comprised in the order shall be Crown land.

9 The provisions of section 299 of this Act relating to the registration of partition orders, so far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, shall apply to the registration of amalgamation orders made under this section.

308 Aggregation orders

1 Where the Court is satisfied that any 2 or more areas of land to which this Part of this Act applies could be more conveniently worked or dealt with if they were held in common ownership, but that there is no reason to cancel the existing titles, it may make an aggregation order vesting the areas of land in the aggregate of the owners of those areas.

2 Upon registration under the Land Transfer Act 1952, an aggregation order made under this section shall take effect according to its tenor to vest the land described in the order in the persons and in the shares named in the order.

3 Any Crown land that, pursuant to this section, is vested in any Maori shall thereupon become Maori freehold land and the aggregation order shall so state.

4 Subject to subsection (5), the Court may at any time cancel any aggregation order made under this section or under the corresponding provisions of any former enactment, whether or not that order has been registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952; and, in every such case,

a Each area of the land comprised in the order shall be deemed to be held by those persons who held it at the time of the making of the order or by their successors in title, and in the same relative shares; and

b Section 306(5) of this Act shall apply, with any necessary modifications, as if the aggregation order were a partition order.

5 Despite subsection (4), but subject to subsections (6) and (7), the provisions of section 293 relating to the Court's power to award, in a partition order, compensation for improvements effected on the land to which the order relates apply, with any necessary modifications, to the cancellation of any aggregation order under this section.

6 Where land that will be affected by the cancellation of an aggregation order is

a land in respect of which a trust is constituted under Part 12; or

b land vested in a Maori incorporation,the Court may not exercise the power conferred on the Court by subsection (5) unless it has first consulted the trustees or the management committee of the incorporation, as the case may require.

7 The Court may not, under section 293(1) (as applied by subsection (5)), award additional land to any owner unless it is satisfied that the owner of the additional land has been given a reasonable opportunity of recompensing the owner who effected the improvements that would be the basis for the award of additional land.

309 Orders to specify relative interests of owners

1 Every amalgamation order and every aggregation order shall set forth the relative interests of the several owners of the land, which, subject to subsection (3) of this section, shall be calculated by reference to the relative values of the interests to which they were entitled before the making of the order.

2 For the purposes of calculating those relative values, the Court may, if it thinks it equitable to do so, adopt values, whether capital or land values, other than those appearing in the district valuation roll for the time being in force under the Rating Valuations Act 1998.

3 Instead of calculating the relative interests of the owners by reference to the relative values of the interests to which they were entitled before the making of the order, the Court may calculate the relative interests in accordance with any understanding or arrangement between the several groups of owners as to a basis of amalgamation otherwise than as specified in subsection (2) of this section, if it is satisfied that the basis is, in all the circumstances, equitable.



310 Court may make exchange orders

1 For the purpose of giving effect to the exchange of any land to which this Part of this Act applies, or of any interest in any such land, for any other land (whether land to which this Part of this Act applies or not), or for any other interest in land, the Court may make exchange orders in accordance with sections 311 to 314 of this Act.

1 The Court shall not make an exchange order unless it is satisfied in respect of the following matters:

a That the exchange is not detrimental to the interests of the Maori owners affected by the exchange:

b That, if the interests to be exchanged are unequal in value, a sufficient sum of money by way of equality of exchange has been actually paid or sufficient security for its payment has been given:

c That the Maori owners of the land affected by the exchange have had sufficient notice of the application for an exchange order and sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider it, and that there is a sufficient degree of support for the application among the owners, having regard to the nature and importance of the matter.

2 Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1)(b) of this section, in any case to which that provision applies the Court may waive the requirement to pay a sum of money by way of equality of exchange if it is satisfied that the exchange is in the nature of a family arrangement and that, apart from the inequality of the exchange, no party to it is adversely affected.

313 Effect of exchange order

1 An exchange order shall operate according to its tenor to transfer and vest the respective estates and interests expressed to be exchanged in the same manner as if all necessary instruments of assurance had been lawfully executed by and between all persons interested, and as if all those persons has been fully competent to execute the instruments.

2 When any General land becomes vested in any Maori or in a trustee for any Maori for an estate in fee simple, whether legal or equitable, in exchange for Maori freehold land in accordance with this Part of this Act, the General land so exchanged shall thereupon become Maori freehold land.

314 Money payable by way of equality of exchange to be charge on land

4 By the same or a subsequent order, the Court may amend any existing title to include in it the land comprised in the road or portion of the road that has been closed, and the District Land Registrar is hereby authorised to make all necessary entries or amendments in any certificate of title or register.

5 Unless the Court otherwise orders, any land that is vested in any Maori pursuant to this section shall thereupon become Maori freehold land.

326 Alienation of land to include alienation of interest in roadway giving access to that land

1 Where any roadway that is comprised in a separate instrument of title has, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, been laid out by the Court over any Maori freehold land, the transfer by sale or otherwise of any land to which the roadway gives access shall, unless the instrument of alienation expressly provides to the contrary, be and be deemed to have been a transfer by the alienor to the alienee of the alienor's interest (if any) in the roadway.

2 If any such instrument of title is registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952, the alienee may apply for registration under that Act of any interest to which the alienee has become entitled under this section, and the District Land Registrar may register the same accordingly.

3 In any case to which subsection (1) of this section does not apply, the alienee of any land to which any roadway gives access (whether or not a separate title exists in respect of the roadway) shall have the same rights of access and be subject to the same obligations as were enjoyed by or imposed on the alienor in respect of the roadway before the transfer.
