1 If property has been disposed of by a receiver, all security interests in the property and its proceeds that are subordinate to the security interest of the person in whose interests the receiver was appointed are extinguished on the disposition of the property.

2 If there is a surplus left after the receiver has disposed of personal property, that surplus must be distributed according to the priorities set out in section 30B(1) and (2) unless otherwise required by any other law.

30B Priorities on distribution by receiver of surplus representing proceeds of personal property

1 A surplus representing the proceeds of personal property must be distributed in the following order:

a to any person who has registered a financing statement under the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, or a security interest under any other Act, in the name of the grantor over the property, if

i the registration was effective immediately before the receiver disposed of the property; and

ii the security interest relating to that registration was subordinate to the security interest of the person in whose interests the receiver was appointed:

b to any other person (A), if the receiver has notice that A had an interest in the property when it was disposed of, and the receiver is satisfied that A's interest was legally enforceable:

c to the grantor.

2 Priority as between persons referred to in subsection(1)(a), and as between persons referred to in subsection(1)(b), must be determined according to the applicable law (including Part7 or Part 8 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999) as if, in the case of persons referred to in subsection (1)(a), their security interests had not been extinguished.

3 If, in the case of a distribution of the surplus to a grantor, the grantor cannot be found after reasonable inquiry by the receiver, the provisions of section 186(2) to (5) of the Property Law Act 2007 apply with all necessary modifications as if references in that section to the mortgagee and the mortgagor were references to the receiver and the grantor respectively.

30C Surplus may be paid into court

1 A receiver may pay a surplus referred to in section 30A(2) into court if there is a question as to who is entitled to receive payment according to the priorities in section 30B(1) or (2).

2 The surplus may only be paid out on an application by the receiver or by a person claiming an entitlement to the surplus.

30D Meaning of surplus and net proceeds

1 For the purposes of sections 30A to 30C, there is a surplus if the receiver has disposed of personal property in receivership, and the net proceeds exceed

a the amount of the debt owed by the grantor to the person in whose interests the receiver was appointed (where the property secures payment of that debt); or

b the monetary value of the obligation owed by the grantor to the person in whose interests the receiver was appointed (where the property secures performance of that obligation).

2 In subsection (1), *net proceeds*, in relation to the disposal of personal property in receivership, means the net proceeds of the disposal after deducting

a the receiver's expenses and remuneration; and

b any amount or the monetary value of any obligation, as the case may be, secured by any security interest that ranks in priority to the security interest granted to the person in whose interests the receiver was appointed; and

c any other preferential claims or priority claims according to law.

31 Powers of receiver on liquidation or bankruptcy

1 Subject to subsection (2), a receiver may be appointed or continue to act as a receiver and exercise all the powers of a receiver in respect of property of

a a company that is being wound up or that has been put into liquidation; or

b a debtor who has been adjudged bankrupt under the Insolvency Act 2006unless the court orders otherwise.

2 A receiver holding office in respect of property referred to in subsection (1) may act as the agent of the grantor only

a with the approval of the court; or

b with the written consent of the liquidator or the Official Assignee, as the case may be.

3 A receiver who, by reason of subsection (2), is not able to act as the agent of the grantor does not, by reason only of that fact, become the agent of a person by whom or in whose interests the receiver was appointed.

4 A debt or liability incurred by a grantor through the acts of a receiver who is acting as the agent of the grantor in accordance with subsection (2) is not a cost, charge or expense of the liquidation or the administration of the bankrupt's estate.

32 Liabilities of receiver

1 Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a receiver is personally liable

a on a contract entered into by the receiver in the exercise of any of the receiver's powers; and

c for payment of remuneration under any contract with

i a director of a grantor that is a body corporate; or

ii a person who, in relation to a grantor that is not a body corporate, occupies a position equivalent to that of a director of a body corporateif the receiver has expressly confirmed the contract.

a limit the liability of the receiver to a greater extent than that specified in subsection (6):

40A Instrument may provide for appointment of receiver
Subject to the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, and without limiting any other rights or remedies of the holder of a charge over any asset of a local authority, an instrument creating or evidencing the terms and conditions of the charge may provide for the appointment of a receiver of such assets in such terms as the parties may agree and the holder of that charge may exercise any such other rights or use any such other remedies.

40B Power of court to appoint receiver

1 Subject to sections 40D and 40E and to subsections(2) and (3), the High Court may, on the application of any creditor of the local authority, appoint a receiver of any asset of a local authority or appoint a receiver for the purposes of section 115 of the Local Government Act 2002.

2 An appointment under subsection (1) must be for such period, with such rights, powers, and duties, and on such terms and conditions, including as to security and remuneration, as the court considers appropriate in all the circumstances.

3 When considering, in accordance with subsection (2), the terms and conditions upon which a receiver can be appointed by a court pursuant to subsection (1), the court must

a take account of the interests of both the secured and non-secured creditors of the local authority, as against

i the interests of the local authority itself; and

ii the requirement of the local authority to provide those services that are essential for the maintenance of public health and safety; and

iii the interests of the ratepayers with property within the area of the local authority; and

iv the interests of the general public living within the area of the local authority; and

b take account of the interests of secured creditors as against the interests of non-secured creditors of the local authority.

40C Powers and duties of receivers

1 A receiver of any asset of a local authority is, as the circumstances and the context permit, affected by the restrictions and responsibilities which by law affect a receiver of a company or of an asset or property or rights of a company as if the local authority were a company.

2 The provisions of this Act are, in their application to a receiver of an asset of a local authority, subject to the modifications and exceptions set out in the Schedule.

3 If the assets subject to a charge to which this section applies comprise rates or other revenues, then, for the purposes of this section, from the date of the appointment of the receiver and until such time as the appointment terminates,

a the rates or other revenues so charged vest in the receiver; and

b all powers necessary for the recovery of rates levied under section 115 of the Local Government Act 2002 or other revenues are conferred on, and may be exercised by, the receiver.

40D Constraints on receiver

1 Despite anything in this Act or in any instrument providing for or governing the appointment of a receiver, a receiver of any asset of a local authority must ensure that no action of the receiver prevents the provision of those services of the local authority that are essential for the maintenance of public health and safety requirements.

2 For the purposes of this section,

a an action of a receiver is deemed not to prevent provision of the services specified in subsection (1) unless

i that action necessarily results in that outcome; and

ii the outcome is not more fairly attributable to the act, or omission to act, of persons outside the control of the receiver; and

b *receiver* includes both a receiver and a manager and includes, if persons are appointed jointly or severally as receivers and managers or both jointly and severally as receivers or managers, each of those persons.

3 A receiver must distribute the proceeds of collection of the money and assets the receiver is entitled to collect in the following order of priority:

a first, the receiver's remuneration, and costs incurred by the receiver and reimbursement of the costs of obtaining appointment of the receiver to any person who has incurred them:

b second, any amounts payable in respect of claims by law to be preferred to claims under any charge over those assets:

c third, any amounts required to be paid out of the proceeds of collection of the money and assets to enable the receiver to provide the services specified in subsection(1):

d fourth, the amounts secured by any charges over those assets in the order of priority accorded those charges, so as to preserve the respective entitlements of the holders of those charges:

e fifth, if the receiver was appointed on the application of an unsecured creditor or unsecured creditors, to those creditors or, as the court may direct, any amounts payable to them,and any residue must be paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the local authority, as it may direct.

4 A receiver appointed under section 40A or section 40B(1), in exercising any powers (including those of a manager), is not entitled to control, dispose of, or otherwise interfere with the local authority's ability to exercise or perform its rights, powers, and duties in relation to assets not charged in favour of the appointor of a receiver.

5 Subject to subsection(6), if any land vested in a local authority is

a a reserve under the Reserves Act 1977; or

b land over which the local authority has no power of disposition; or

c land in respect of which the local authority's power of disposition is conditional,the power of disposition that a receiver of that local authority has in respect of that land is limited to a power of disposition by way of lease or licence for a term or terms not exceeding in the aggregate 9years.

6 The powers of disposition that a receiver has in respect of any land of the kind described in subsection(5)(c) comprise, in addition to the power specified in subsection (5), the same conditional power of disposition as the local authority.

40E Protection for receiver

1 Subject to subsection(4), no proceedings lie against any receiver of a local authority for breach of section40D(1)

a by the receiver; or

b by any adviser or delegate of the receiver (being an adviser or delegate who has been reasonably selected and reasonably supervised).

2 Subject to subsection (4), no proceedings lie against any adviser or delegate of any receiver of a local authority for a breach of section40D other than at the instance of the receiver.

3 Subject to subsection (4), a receiver (and any adviser or delegate who has been reasonably selected and reasonably supervised, as the case requires), must, in respect of any liability relating to the exercise or purported exercise or omission to exercise any right or power of the receiver by the receiver or the adviser of the receiver or the delegate of the receiver, be indemnified

a by the local authority, in the case of a receiver appointed by the High Court under section40B(1):

b out of the assets subject to receivership, in the case of any other receiver but subject to any contrary terms of appointment.

4 No person is exempted from liability under subsection(1) or is entitled to be indemnified under subsection(3) for any act or omission to act which constitutes bad faith or gross negligence on the part of that person.

5 Nothing in this section limits or affects the provisions of sections19 and 20.
