2 The directors who vote in favour of a distribution must sign a certificate stating that, in their opinion, the company will, immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test and the grounds for that opinion.

3 If, after a distribution is authorised and before it is made, the board ceases to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will, immediately after the distribution is made, satisfy the solvency test, any distribution made by the company is deemed not to have been authorised.

b *liabilities*  includes the amount that would be required, if the company were to be removed from the New Zealand register after the distribution, to repay all fixed preferential amounts payable by the company to shareholders, at that time, or on earlier redemption (except where such fixed preferential amounts are expressed in the constitution as being subject to the power of directors to make distributions); but, subject to paragraph (a), does not include dividends payable in the future.

5 Every director who fails to comply with subsection (2) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to the penalty set out in section 373(1).

53 Dividends

1 A dividend is a distribution other than a distribution to which section 59 or section 76 applies.

2 The board of a company must not authorise a dividend

a in respect of some but not all the shares in a class; or

b that is of a greater value per share in respect of some shares of a class than it is in respect of other shares of that classunless the amount of the dividend in respect of a share of that class is in proportion to the amount paid to the company in satisfaction of the liability of the shareholder under the constitution of the company or under the terms of issue of the share or is required, for a portfolio tax rate entity, as a result of section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

3 Notwithstanding subsection (2), a shareholder may waive his or her entitlement to receive a dividend by notice in writing to the company signed by or on behalf of the shareholder.

54 Shares in lieu of dividends
Subject to the constitution of the company, the board of a company may issue shares to any shareholders who have agreed to accept the issue of shares, wholly or partly, in lieu of a proposed dividend or proposed future dividends if

a the right to receive shares, wholly or partly, in lieu of the proposed dividend or proposed future dividends has been offered to all shareholders of the same class on the same terms; and

b if all shareholders elected to receive the shares in lieu of the proposed dividend, relative voting or distribution rights, or both, would be maintained; and

a fair and reasonable to the company and to all shareholders; and

b to be available to all shareholders or all shareholders of the same class on the same terms.

3 A discount scheme may not be approved or continued by the board unless it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company satisfies the solvency test.

4 Subject to subsection (5), a discount accepted by a shareholder under a discount scheme approved under this section is not a distribution for the purposes of this Act.

5 Where

a a discount is accepted by a shareholder under a scheme approved or continued by the board; and

b at the time the scheme was approved or the discount was offered, the board ceased to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company would satisfy the solvency test,the provisions of section 56 shall apply in relation to the discount with such modifications as may be necessary as if the discount were a distribution that is deemed not to have been authorised.

56 Recovery of distributions

1 A distribution made to a shareholder at a time when the company did not, immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test may be recovered by the company from the shareholder unless

a the shareholder received the distribution in good faith and without knowledge of the company's failure to satisfy the solvency test; and

b the shareholder has altered the shareholder's position in reliance on the validity of the distribution; and

c it would be unfair to require repayment in full or at all.

2 If, in relation to a distribution made to shareholders,

a the procedure set out in section 52 or section 70 or section 77, as the case may be, has not been followed; or

b reasonable grounds for believing that the company would satisfy the solvency test in accordance with section 52 or section 70 or section 77, as the case may be, did not exist at the time the certificate was signed,a director who

c failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the procedure was followed; or

d signed the certificate, as the case may be,is personally liable to the company to repay to the company so much of the distribution as is not able to be recovered from shareholders.

3 If, by virtue of section 52(3) or section 70(3) or section 77(3), as the case may be, a distribution is deemed not to have been authorised, a director who

a ceased after authorisation but before the making of the distribution to be satisfied on reasonable grounds for believing that the company would satisfy the solvency test immediately after the distribution is made; and

b failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the distribution being made,is personally liable to the company to repay to the company so much of the distribution as is not able to be recovered from shareholders.

4 If, by virtue of section 55(5), a distribution is deemed not to have been authorised, a director who failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the distribution being made is personally liable to the company to repay to the company so much of the distribution as is not able to be recovered from shareholders.

5 If, in an action brought against a director or shareholder under this section, the court is satisfied that the company could, by making a distribution of a lesser amount, have satisfied the solvency test, the court may

a permit the shareholder to retain; or

b relieve the director from liability in respect ofan amount equal to the value of any distribution that could properly have been made.

57 Reduction of shareholder liability a distribution

1 If a company proposes to alter its constitution, or to acquire shares issued by it, or redeem shares under section 69, as the case may be, in a manner which would cancel or reduce the liability of a shareholder to the company in relation to a share held prior to that alteration, acquisition, or redemption, the proposed cancellation or reduction of liability is to be treated,

a for the purposes of section 52, as if it were a distribution; and

b for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of section 53, as if it were a dividend.

2 If a company has altered its constitution, or acquired shares, or redeemed shares under section 69, as the case may be, in a manner which cancels or reduces the liability of a shareholder to the company in relation to a share held prior to that alteration, acquisition, or redemption, that cancellation or reduction of liability is to be treated for the purposes of section 56 as a distribution of the amount by which that liability was reduced.

3 If the liability of a shareholder of an amalgamating company to that company in relation to a share held before the amalgamation is

a greater than the liability of that shareholder to the amalgamated company in relation to a share or shares into which that share is converted; or

b cancelled by the cancellation of that share in the amalgamation,the reduction of liability effected by the amalgamation is to be treated for the purposes of section 56(1) and (5) as a distribution by the amalgamated company to that shareholder, whether or not that shareholder becomes a shareholder of the amalgamated company of the amount by which that liability was reduced.

2 Where

a all or part of the consideration payable in respect of the issue of a share remains unsatisfied; and

b the person to whom the share was issued no longer holds that share,liability in respect of that unsatisfied consideration does not attach to subsequent holders of the share, but remains the liability of the person to whom the share was issued, or of any other person who assumed that liability at the time of issue.

110 Shareholder may require company to purchase shares
Where

a a shareholder is entitled to vote on the exercise of 1 or more of the powers set out in

i section 106(1)(a), and the proposed alteration imposes or removes a restriction on the activities of the company; or

ii section 106(1)(b) or (c); and

b the shareholders resolved, pursuant to section 106, to exercise the power; and

c the shareholder cast all the votes attached to shares registered in the shareholder's name and having the same beneficial owner against the exercise of the power; or

d where the resolution to exercise the power was passed under section 122, the shareholder did not sign the resolution,that shareholder is entitled to require the company to purchase those shares in accordance with section 111.

111 Notice requiring purchase

1 A shareholder of a company who is entitled to require the company to purchase shares by virtue of section 110 or section 118 may,

a within 10 working days of the passing of the resolution at a meeting of shareholders; or

b where the resolution was passed under section 122, before the expiration of 10 working days after the date on which notice of the passing of the resolution is given to the shareholder,give a written notice to the company requiring the company to purchase those shares.

2 Within 20 working days of receiving a notice under subsection (1), the board must

a agree to the purchase of the shares by the company; or

b arrange for some other person to agree to purchase the shares; or

c apply to the court for an order under section 114 or section 115; or

d arrange, before taking the action concerned, for the resolution to be rescinded in accordance with section 106 or decide in the appropriate manner not to take the action concerned, as the case may be; and

e give written notice to the shareholder of the board's decision under this subsection.

112 Price for shares to be purchased by company determined

1 Within 5 working days of giving notice under section 111(2)(e) that the board agrees to the purchase of shares by the company, the board must give to the holder of the shares written notice of

a the price it offers to pay for those shares; and

b how

i the matters in subsection (2) were calculated; or

ii the price was calculated under subsection (3) and why calculating the price using the methodology set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (2) would be clearly unfair.

2 That price must be a fair and reasonable price (as at the close of business on the day before the date on which the resolution was passed) for the shares held by the shareholder, calculated as follows:

a first, the fair and reasonable value of the total shares in each class to which the shares belong must be calculated (the *class value* ):

b secondly, each class value must be adjusted to exclude any fluctuation (whether positive or negative) in the class value that has occurred (whether before or after the resolution was passed) that was due to, or in expectation of, the event proposed or authorised by the resolution:

c thirdly, a portion of each adjusted class value must be allocated to the shareholder in proportion to the number of shares he, she, or it holds in the relevant class.

3 However, a different methodology from that set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (2) may be used to calculate the fair and reasonable price for the shares if using the methodology set out in those paragraphs would be clearly unfair to the shareholder or the company.

4 The shareholder may object to the price offered by the board for the shares by giving written notice to the company no later than 10 working days after the date on which the board gave written notice to the shareholder under subsection (1).

5 If the company does not receive an objection to the price in accordance with subsection (4), the company must purchase all the shares at the nominated price no later than 10 working days after

a the date on which the boards offer under subsection (1) is accepted; or

b if the board has not received an acceptance, the date that is 10 working days after the date on which the board gave written notice to the shareholder under subsection (1).

6 The time periods in subsection (5) do not apply if there is a written agreement between the board and the shareholder that specifically sets a different date for purchase of the shares.

7 In this section, *resolution*  means the resolution referred to in section 110 or 118 that, due to it having been passed, entitles the shareholder to require the company to purchase the shareholders shares in accordance with section 111.

112A Price for shares referred to arbitration if shareholder objects to price

1 If a company receives an objection to the price offered for shares in accordance with section 112(4),

a the following issues must be submitted to arbitration:

i the fair and reasonable price for the shares, on the basis set out in section 112(2) and (3); and

ii the remedies available to the holder of the shares or the company in respect of any price for the shares that differs from that determined by the board under section 112; and

b the company must, within 5 working days of receiving the objection, pay to the shareholder a provisional price in respect of each share equal to the price offered by the board under section 112(1).

2 If the price determined for the shares

a exceeds the provisional price paid, the arbitral tribunal must order the company to pay the balance owing to the shareholder:

b is less than the provisional price paid, the arbitral tribunal must order the shareholder to pay the excess to the company.

3 Except in exceptional circumstances, an arbitral tribunal must award interest on any balance owing or excess to be paid under subsection (2).

4 If a balance is owing to the shareholder, an arbitral tribunal may award to the shareholder, in addition to or instead of an award of interest, damages for loss attributable to the shortfall in the initial payment.

5 Any sum that must be paid in accordance with this section must be paid no later than 10 days after the date of the arbitral tribunals determination, unless the arbitral tribunal specifically orders otherwise.

6 A submission to arbitration under this section is an arbitration agreement for the purposes of the Arbitration Act 1996, and the provisions of that Act apply accordingly.

7 Clause 6 of Schedule 2 of the Arbitration Act 1996 may not be excluded from the arbitration agreement, and the term *costs and expenses of an arbitration*  in that clause includes, where a balance is owing to the shareholder,

a the reasonable legal costs of the shareholder on a solicitor-and-client basis; and

b the reasonable costs of expert witnesses.

112B Interest payable on outstanding payments

1 Interest on any sum that must be paid under section 112 or 112A that is outstanding after the date on which it falls due is payable,

a in the case of a share price determined under section112, at the same rate of interest as the prescribed rate under section87(3) of the Judicature Act 1908; and

b in the case of a share price determined under section112A, on the basis and at the rate that the arbitral tribunal thinks fit having regard to all of the circumstances.

2 The sum on which interest is payable under subsection (1)(b) includes any interest or damages for loss awarded under section 112A.

112C Timing of transfer of shares

1 On the day on which a board gives notice under section 111(2)(e) that the board agrees to the purchase of shares by the company,

b the rights of the shareholder in relation to those shares end.

2 However, for the purposes of sections 112 and 112A, *shareholder*  and *holder of the shares*  means the person who held the legal title to the shares immediately before the board gave notice under section 111(2)(e) that the board agrees to the purchase of those shares by the company.

3 Subsection (2) applies despite subsection (1).

1 Sections 112 to 112C apply to the purchase of shares by a person with whom the company has entered into an arrangement for purchase in accordance with section 111(2)(b) subject to such modifications as may be necessary, and, in particular, as if references in that section to the board and the company were references to that person.

2 Every holder of shares that are to be purchased in accordance with the arrangement is indemnified by the company in respect of loss suffered by reason of the failure by the person who has agreed to purchase the shares to purchase them at the price nominated or fixed by arbitration, as the case may be.

114 Court may grant exemption

1 A company to which a notice has been given under section 111 may apply to the court for an order exempting it from the obligation to purchase the shares to which the notice relates on the grounds that

a the purchase would be disproportionately damaging to the company; or

b the company cannot reasonably be required to finance the purchase; or

c it would not be just and equitable to require the company to purchase the shares.

2 On an application under this section, the court may make an order exempting the company from the obligation to purchase the shares, and may make any other order it thinks fit, including an order

a setting aside a resolution of the shareholders:

b directing the company to take, or refrain from taking, any action specified in the order:

c requiring the company to pay compensation to the shareholders affected:

d that the company be put into liquidation.

3 The court shall not make an order under subsection (2) on either of the grounds set out in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that the company has made reasonable efforts to arrange for another person to purchase the shares in accordance with section 111(2)(b).

115 Court may grant exemption if company insolvent

1 If

a a notice is given to a company under section 111; and

b the board has resolved that the purchase by the company of the shares to which the notice relates would result in it failing to satisfy the solvency test; and

c the company has, having made reasonable efforts to do so, been unable to arrange for the shares to be purchased by another person in accordance with section 111(2)(b),the company must apply to the court for an order exempting it from the obligation to purchase the shares.

a the purchase of the shares would result in the company failing to satisfy the solvency test; and

b the company has made reasonable efforts to arrange for the shares to be purchased by another person in accordance with section 111(2)(b),make

c an order exempting the company from the obligation to purchase the shares:

b the issue is made in accordance with the pre-emptive rights of shareholders under section 45 or under the constitution of the company.

b reasonable grounds did not exist for the opinion set out in the certificate given under subsection (4),the director or former director to whom the payment is made or the benefit is provided, or in respect of whom the guarantee is given, as the case may be, is personally liable to the company for the amount of the payment, or the monetary value of the benefit, or any amount paid by the company under the guarantee, except to the extent to which he or she proves that the payment or benefit or guarantee was fair to the company at the time it was made, provided, or given.

a that the shareholder will pay the charge; or

b that the shareholder considers the charge to be unreasonable.

6 The court may, on the application of a person who has made a request for information, if it is satisfied that

a the period specified for providing the information is unreasonable; or

b the charge set by the company is unreasonable,as the case may be, make an order requiring the company to supply the information within such time or on payment of such charge as the court thinks fit.

7 The court may, on the application of a person who has made a request for information, if it is satisfied that

a the company does not have sufficient reason to refuse to supply the information; or

b the company has sufficient reason to refuse to supply the information but that other reasons exist that outweigh the refusal,the court may make an order requiring the company to supply the information.

8 Where the court makes an order under subsection (7), it may specify the use that may be made of the information and the persons to whom it may be disclosed.

3 A person appointed by the court under subsection (1) must diligently carry out the inspection and, having done so, must make a full report to the court.

5 An order made under subsection (4) may be varied from time to time.

6 The reasonable costs of the inspection must be met by the company unless the court orders otherwise.

7 A person may only disclose or make use of information or records obtained under this section in accordance with an order made under subsection (4) or subsection (5).

c an obligation which, if entered into by a natural person, is not, by law, required to be in writing, may be entered into on behalf of the company in writing or orally by a person acting under the company's express or implied authority.

1A A company may, in addition to complying with subsection (1), affix its common seal, if it has one, to the contract or document containing the enforceable obligation.

2 Subsection (1) applies to a contract or other obligation

a whether or not that contract or obligation was entered into in New Zealand; and

b whether or not the law governing the contract or obligation is the law of New Zealand.

181 Attorneys

1 Subject to its constitution, a company may, by an instrument in writing executed in accordance with section 180(1)(a), appoint a person as its attorney either generally or in relation to a specified matter.

2 An act of the attorney in accordance with the instrument binds the company.

3 Sections 19 to 21 of the Property Law Act 2007 apply, with all necessary modifications, in relation to a power of attorney executed by a company, to the same extent as if the company was a natural person and as if the commencement of the liquidation or, if there is no liquidation, the removal from the register kept for the purposes of this Act of the company was an event revoking the power of attorney within the meaning of those sections.



182 Pre-incorporation contracts may be ratified

1 In this section and in sections 183 to 185, the term *pre-incorporation contract*  means

a a contract purporting to be made by a company before its incorporation; or

2 Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law, a pre-incorporation contract may be ratified within such period as may be specified in the contract, or if no period is specified, then within a reasonable time after the incorporation of the company in the name of which, or on behalf of which, it has been made.

3 A contract that is ratified is as valid and enforceable as if the company had been a party to the contract when it was made.

4 A pre-incorporation contract may be ratified by a company in the same manner as a contract may be entered into on behalf of a company under section 180.

183 Warranties implied in pre-incorporation contracts

1 Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law, in a pre-incorporation contract, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the contract, there is an implied warranty by the person who purports to make the contract in the name of, or on behalf of, the company

b that the company will ratify the contract within such period as may be specified in the contract, or if no period is specified, then within a reasonable time after the incorporation of the company.

2 The amount of damages recoverable in an action for breach of a warranty implied by subsection (1) is the same as the amount of damages that would be recoverable in an action against the company for damages for breach by the company of the unperformed obligations under the contract if the contract had been ratified and cancelled.

3 If, after its incorporation, a company enters into a contract in the same terms as, or in substitution for, a pre-incorporation contract (not being a contract ratified by the company under section 182 ), the liability of a person under subsection (1) (including any liability under an order made by the court for the payment of damages) is discharged.

184 Failure to ratify

1 A party to a pre-incorporation contract that has not been ratified by the company after its incorporation may apply to the court for an order

a directing the company to return property, whether real or personal, acquired under the contract to that party; or

b for any other relief in favour of that party relating to that property; or

c validating the contract whether in whole or in part.

2 The court may, if it considers it just and equitable to do so, make any order or grant any relief it thinks fit and may do so whether or not an order has been made under section 183(2).

185 Breach of pre-incorporation contract
In proceedings against a company for breach of a pre-incorporation contract which has been ratified by the company, the court may, on the application of the company, any other party to the proceedings, or of its own motion, make such order for the payment of damages or other relief as the court considers just and equitable, in addition to or in substitution for any order which may be made against the company, against a person by whom the contract was made.

185A Jurisdiction of District Courts

1 A District Court shall have jurisdiction to exercise any power conferred by sections 182 to 185  in any case where

a the occasion for the exercise of the power arises in the course of civil proceedings properly before the court; or

b the amount of the claim or the value of the property or relief claimed or in issue is not more than $200,000; or

c the parties agree, in accordance with section 37 of the District Courts Act 1947, that a District Court shall have jurisdiction to determine the proceedings.

2 For the purposes of section 43 of the District Courts Act 1947, an application made to a District Court under any of sections 182 to 185 shall be deemed to be a proceeding.

239W Administrator is company's agent
The administrator of a company, when performing a function or exercising a power in that capacity, is the company's agent.

239X Effect on directors

1 The appointment of an administrator does not remove the directors of the company from office.

2 However, a director of a company that is in administration must not exercise or perform, or purport to exercise or perform, a function or power as a director of the company except

a with the prior, written approval of the administrator; or

b as expressly permitted by this Part.

239Y Effect on employees

2 The administrator is not personally liable for any obligation of the company under an employment agreement to which the company is a party, unless

a the administrator expressly adopts the agreement in writing; or

c on or before the day on which the bank was notified in writing by the administrator that the administration had begun, or before the bank had reason to believe that the company was in administration, whichever was earlier.

b altering the rights and liabilities of a shareholder in a company in administration.

239AC Effect on liquidation

1 The appointment of an administrator to a company in liquidation suspends the liquidation, including the powers of the liquidator to act on the company's behalf, but does not remove the liquidator from office.

3 In this section, *liquidator*  includes a liquidator or interim liquidator appointed before the administration began.
