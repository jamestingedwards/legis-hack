1 An inspector must not give a biosecurity clearance for goods that are or contain an organism specified in Schedule 2 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 or for a new organism.

1A However, subsection (1) does not prohibit an inspector from giving a biosecurity clearance for goods the importation of which involves, or might involve, an incidentally imported new organism.

2 Where any new organism is an organism for which

a the Authority has given approval for importation into containment in accordance with sections 42 or 45 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996: and

b there is in existence a containment facility approved as meeting the standard set by the Authority; and

c the organism is able to go to that facility,any inspectormay authorise that organism to go to that containment facility.

28A Dealing with suspected new organism

1 Any inspector may seize any organism which the inspector has reason to believe may be a new organism.

2 The provisions of sections 116 and 117 apply to any organism seized under subsection (1) as if that organism were unauthorised goods.

3 A chief technical officer may permit an organism seized under this section to be held in the custody of the Director-General for so long as is necessary for the importer to apply to the Authority for a determination under section 26 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 that the organism is, or is not, a new organism.

4 Where an organism is held in accordance with this section, the estimated costs and expenses of the custody and maintenance of the organism must be paid in advance to the Director-General by the importer.

5 When the Director-General's custody of an organism ceases, the Director-General must calculate the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of holding the organism and, if those actual and reasonable costs

a exceed the amount paid in accordance with subsection (4), the balance of the costs and expenses are recoverable as a debt due to the Crown from the importer:

b are less than the amount paid in accordance with subsection (4), the overpayment must be refunded to the importer.

6 Where any organism held under subsection (3) is declared to be a new organism, the chief technical officer may, either generally or in any particular case, give any reasonable directions as to the disposal of, or any other dealing with, that organism, but must not give a biosecurity clearance for that organism.

28B Biosecurity clearance for certain new organisms and qualifying organisms
Section 28 does not apply to organisms approved under the following sections of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act1996:

a section 38BA:

b section 38C:

c section 38I:

d section 48:

e section 49F.

29 Restricted organisms to be contained

i that each proposed rule

i would assist in achieving the plan's objectives; and

ii would not trespass unduly on the rights of individuals; and

j that the proposal is not frivolous or vexatious; and

k that the proposal is clear enough to be readily understood; and

l that, if the Minister rejected a similar proposal within the last 3 years, new and material information answers the Minister's objection to the previous proposal.

1 If the Minister is satisfied of the matters in section 62, the Minister may take the third step in the making of a plan, which is for the Minister to consider whether the Minister is satisfied

a that, if Ministers' responsibilities may be affected by the plan, the Ministers have been consulted; and

b that, if local authorities' responsibilities may be affected by the plan, the authorities have been consulted; and

c that, if consultation with tangata whenua or other persons is appropriate, sufficient consultation has occurred.

a consultation with persons likely to be affected by the plan or with their representatives:

b the appointment by the Minister of 1 or more persons to carry out an independent inquiry into the proposal on terms of reference set by the Minister:

c public notification of the proposal and the receipt of submissions.

6 After the consultation required by the Minister has been undertaken, the Minister must apply subsection (1) again.

64 Fourth step: approval of preparation of plan and decision on management agency

1 If the Minister is satisfied as required by section 63(1) and is satisfied that the issues raised in all the consultation undertaken on the proposal have been considered, the Minister may take the fourth step in the making of a plan, which is to approve the preparation of a plan.

2 If the Minister approves the preparation of a plan, the Minister must apply section 100 to decide which body is to be the management agency.Matters to be specified

a the movement into, within, or from the controlled area of such organisms, organic material, risk goods or other goods as are specified in the notice is restricted, regulated, or prohibited in the manner, to the extent and subject to the conditions specified in the notice:

b the organisms, organic material, risk goods, or other goods within the controlled area that are specified in the notice, must be subject to such treatment and procedures as are specified in the notice.

4 A notice given under subsection (3) may be revoked or may from time to time be replaced or amended.

132 Road blocks, cordons, checkpoints, etc

1 In this section, *control* means a road block, a cordon, or a checkpoint.

2 A District Court Judge may, on the written application (made on oath) of a chief technical officer, issue a warrant authorising the establishment of controls in relation to a place or area, if the District Court Judge is satisfied that

a attempts are being made to eradicate or manage a pest or unwanted organism; and

b there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the pest or unwanted organism is present within the place or area; and

c the pest or unwanted organism is not known to be present in the places or areas that are adjacent to the place or area; and

d it is necessary to establish controls in order to

i prevent or limit the risk of the pest or unwanted organism spreading beyond the place or area if any spread of the organism would significantly affect the likely success of the eradication or management of the pest or unwanted organism; or

ii otherwise avoid significant prejudice to the eradication or management of the pest or unwanted organism.

3 The warrant shall be issued for a period of not more than 7days; but may from time to time be renewed (in the form in which it was issued or in any amended form) for a period not exceeding 7 days.

4 The warrant may be issued in writing or orally; but

a if it is issued in writing, it shall specify

i the pest or organism concerned; and

ii the approximate location of every cordon whose establishment it authorises; and

iii the location (either by way of individual descriptions or by way of descriptions of places of any class or classes) of every other control whose establishment it authorises; and

iv the period for which it is granted; and

v the grounds on which it was issued; and

b if it is issued orally, the Judge shall cause to be made and kept a written record of the matters specified in subparagraphs (i) to (v) of paragraph (a).

5 Subsection (4) shall, with any necessary modifications, apply to the renewal of a warrant as if it is the issue of a warrant.

a stop any vehicle, conveyance, or craft, that is at or near the control; or

b detain any vehicle, conveyance, or craft, that is stopped at or near the control, either at the place where it is stopped or at any other convenient place nearby,for the purpose of exercising the powers conferred by subsection (8).

8 A constable who has stopped or detained a vehicle, conveyance, or craft under subsection (7) may

a enter and search that vehicle, conveyance, or craft; and

b open any box or receptacle in that vehicle, conveyance, or craft; and

c seize

i any organism that is the pest or unwanted organism in respect of which the warrant concerned was issued; or

ii any thing that may harbour or contain the pest or unwanted organism in respect of which the warrant concerned was issued; or

iii any thing that, if moved beyond the control, would be moved in breach of section 130(4); or

iv any thing that, if moved beyond the control, would be moved in breach of section 134(1)(b).

8A A chief technical officer may, either generally or in any particular case, give any reasonable directions as to the disposal of, the treatment of, or any other dealing with, any organism or other thing seized in accordance with subsection (8); and any person may dispose of, treat, or otherwise deal with any such organism or thing accordingly.

8B In exercising the powers of a chief technical officer in accordance with subsection (8A), a chief technical officer must, so far as is practicable without significantly prejudicing the successful eradication or management of the pest or unwanted organism concerned, act in a manner that is consistent with avoiding or minimising loss to the owner or person in charge of the organism or other thing that was seized.

9 No person shall,

a while in charge of any vehicle or craft, that is at or near a control, without reasonable excuse fail or refuse to stop it when a constable in uniform asks him or her to stop it, or tries to stop it; or

b while in charge of any vehicle or craft lawfully stopped or detained under this section, without reasonable excuse move it from the place where it is stopped or detained without the permission of a constable.

135 Options for cost recovery

1 The Director-General, every other chief executive, and every management agency, (hereafter in this section and in section 136 referred to as a recovering authority) shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that so much of the costs of administering this Act, including costs incurred as the management agency of a pest management plan or pathway management plan, as are not provided for by money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose are recovered in accordance with the principles of equity and efficiency in accordance with this section and the regulations.

2 In determining appropriate mechanisms for the recovery of costs of a particular function or service, a recovering authority shall ensure that there is recovered any amount by which

a the sum of

i the costs of the function in the current year; and

ii any shortfall in the recovery of the costs in the preceding year; exceeds

b any over-recovery of costs in respect of the preceding year.

3 A recovering authority may recover costs of administering this Act and performing the functions, powers, and duties provided for in this Act by such methods as he or she or it believes on reasonable grounds to be the most suitable and equitable in the circumstances, including any 1 or more of the following methods:

a fixed charges:

b charges fixed on an hourly or other unit basis:

c estimated charges paid before the provision of the service or performance of the function followed by reconciliation and an appropriate payment or refund after provision of the service or performance of the function:

d actual and reasonable charges:

e refundable or non-refundable deposits paid before provision of the service or performance of the function:

f charges imposed on users of services or third parties:

g in the case only of the Director-General or some other chief executive, liens on property in the possession of the Crown.

1 Where all or part of a charge made under this Act or the regulations remains unpaid after 20 working days since the charge was demanded in writing, the debt shall be deemed to have been increased by an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (2).

2 The amount by which an unpaid charge is deemed to have increased is the sum of

a 10% of the debt, or that part of it that remained unpaid after the expiration of the period of 20working days referred to in subsection (1); and

b for every complete period of 6months after the expiration of that period during which the debt or any part of it (including any deemed increase under this section) has remained unpaid, 10% of that debt or that part.

3 If a recovering authority is satisfied that the failure or refusal of any person to pay all or any part of a debt was a result of a genuine dispute between the person and department as to the person's liability to pay the debt, the amount of the debt, or both, the recovering authority may waive the payment of all or any part by which the debt has increased under this section.

4 In an action for recovery of the debt, the court may exercise the power of waiver contained in subsection (3) if the court is satisfied in the terms set out in that subsection.

137 Levies

1 The Governor-General may from time to time, on the recommendation of the responsible Minister, by Order in Council impose a levy payable to the Director-General for the purposes of wholly or partially funding a service provided or function performed by the department for the purposes of this Act.

2 Every levy order shall be deemed to be a regulation for the purposes of the Regulations (Disallowance) Act 1989.

3 The fact that Part 5A provides for levies to be made to fund readiness or response activities does not prevent this section imposing a levy to which both the following apply:

a it is imposed to wholly or partly fund a readiness or response activity; and

b it is imposed on a sector that is not specified in a Gazette notice under section 100ZA.

138 Orders to be confirmed

139 Restrictions on levies
The Minister shall not recommend the making of an order under section 137 unless the Director-General has satisfied the Minister that

a the imposition of a levy recovering the costs of providing or performing a particular service or function is in accordance with the principles of equity and efficiency; and

5 Money deemed by subsection (4) to be held on trust

a is not available for the payment of; and

b is not liable to be attached or taken in execution at the instance ofany creditor of the person responsible for collecting the levy (other than the Director-General).
