2 Except

a to the extent provided in subsections (1), (5), and (6) and section 7A; and

b to the extent that those enactments are expressly amended by section 168(1),this Act must not be construed so as to affect or derogate in any way from the provisions of the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, the Forests Act 1949, the Wildlife Act 1953, the Health Act 1956, the Animal Welfare Act 1999, the Wild Animal Control Act 1977, the Reserves Act 1977, the National Parks Act 1980, the Fisheries Act 1983, the Conservation Act 1987, the Trade in Endangered Species Act 1989, or the Resource Management Act 1991.

3 This Act must not be construed so as to affect or derogate in any way from the provisions of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and, in particular, the provisions of this Act do not affect the obligations of any person under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 in relation to goods.

4 The provisions of this Act in so far as they relate to risk goods must not be construed to take precedence over the powers provided under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 in relation to any controlled drug (as defined in section 2(1) of that Act).

5 The provisions of the Wild Animal Control Act 1977 do not apply to prevent or inhibit the exercise of any powers under the Biosecurity Act 1993 on any land (other than land administered under the Acts listed in Schedule 1 of the Conservation Act 1987) when those powers are used in respect of

a a pest; or

b an unwanted organismthat may be transmitted by any animal to which the Wild Animal Control Act 1977 applies.

6 The provisions of the Wildlife Act 1953 (including any regulations made under that Act)

7A Relationship with Resource Management Act 1991

1 Where any action taken in accordance with any provision in Part 6 in an attempt to eradicate any organism would be in breach of the provisions of Part3 of the Resource Management Act 1991, the responsible Minister may exempt the actions taken in relation to that organism from the provisions of Part 3 of the Resource Management Act 1991 for up to 20 working days if that Minister is satisfied that it is likely that

a the organism is not established in New Zealand, the organism is not known to be established in New Zealand, or the organism is established in New Zealand but is restricted to certain parts of New Zealand; and

b the organism has the potential to cause all or any of significant economic loss, significant adverse effects on human health, or significant environmental loss if it becomes established in New Zealand or if it becomes established throughout New Zealand; and

c it is in the public interest that action be taken immediately in an attempt to eradicate the organism.

2 Before making a decision under subsection (1), the responsible Minister must consult the relevant consent authority (to the extent that is possible in the circumstances), and may consult such other persons as the responsible Minister considers are representative of the persons likely to be affected by the eradication attempt.

3 After making a decision under subsection (1), the responsible Minister must give public notice of the Minister's decision in such a manner as the Minister thinks fit.

4 The public notice must specify

a the organism to be eradicated; and

b the principal actions that may be taken in the attempt to eradicate the organism; and

c the areas affected by the action.

5 A failure to comply with the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) does not affect the validity of any exemption given under this section.

6 Where any action has been exempted from Part 3 of the Resource Management Act 1991 under subsection (1) and the responsible Minister considers that it is necessary to continue action beyond the duration of the exemption to attempt to eradicate the organism, that Minister may recommend that regulations be made continuing the exemption and the Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, make regulations for that purpose.

7 Regulations made under this section come into force on the date of notification in the Gazette, or at the time specified in the regulations, whichever is the later, and continue in force until revoked or until a date not later than the day 2years after the regulations came into force when the regulations expire and are deemed to have been revoked.

8 Where an exemption is granted under subsection (1) or by regulations made under subsection (6), the provisions of Part 3 of the Resource Management Act 1991 do not apply to the actions taken to eradicate the organism while the exemption is in force.

9 Where an exemption from the provisions of the Resource Management Act 1991 has been granted under subsection (1) or by regulations made under subsection (6) and that exemption has ended (either by the expiry of the exemption under subsection (1) or by the revocation of the regulations, as the case may be), the provisions of the Resource Management Act 1991 then apply and the responsible Minister must remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of any actions taken under Part6 and to which the provisions of the Resource Management Act 1991, but for the exemption under this section, would otherwise have applied.

10 For the purposes of this section, *consent authority* has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991.

20 Import health permits

21 Criteria for issue of import health permits

22 Import health standards

1 The Director-General may, following the recommendation of a chief technical officer, issue an import health standard specifying the requirements to be met for the effective management of risks associated with the importation of risk goods before those goods may be imported, moved from a biosecurity control area or a transitional facility, or given a biosecurity clearance; and may, in a like manner, amend or revoke any import health standard so issued.

1A An import health standard issued under this section applies to goods the importation of which involves, or might involve, an incidentally imported new organism.

2 If an import health standard requires a permit to be obtained from the Director-General before the goods can be imported, moved from a biosecurity control area or a transitional facility, or given a biosecurity clearance, the Director-General may, if he or she thinks fit, issue the permit.

3 Nothing in this Act obliges the Director-General to have an import health standard in force for goods of any kind or description if, in the Director-General's opinion, the requirements that could be imposed on the importation of those goods would not be sufficient to enable the purpose of this Part to be met if the importation of those goods were permitted.

4 An import health standard issued under this section may apply to goods of a certain kind or description imported from

a a country or countries specified in the import health standard; or

b countries of a kind or description specified in the import health standard; or

c all countries; or

d a location or locations specified in the import health standard.

5 When making a recommendation to the Director-General in accordance with this section, the chief technical officer must have regard to the following matters:

a the likelihood that goods of the kind or description to be specified in the import health standard may bring organisms into New Zealand:

b the nature and possible effect on people, the New Zealand environment, and the New Zealand economy of any organisms that goods of the kind or description specified in the import health standard may bring into New Zealand:

c New Zealand's international obligations:

d such other matters as the chief technical officer considers relevant to the purpose of this Part.

6 Before making a recommendation to the Director-General on the issue or amendment of an import health standard, the chief technical officer must, unless the standard needs to be issued or amended urgently, or unless the chief technical officer considers that the amendment is minor, consult with those persons considered by the chief technical officer to be representative of the classes of persons having an interest in the standard.

7 The consultation may be on the import health standard or on a document that analyses or assesses the risks associated with the goods or class of goods to which the goods belong.

8 Before making a recommendation to the Director-General in accordance with this section the chief technical officer must give notice of the intention to make the recommendation to the chief executive of every department of State whose responsibilities for natural resources or human health may be adversely affected by the issue, amendment, or revocation of the relevant standard.

9 The Director-General must maintain a register of the import health standards (as amended from time to time) issued under this section.

10 The register must be available for public information and inspection at the office of the Director-General during normal office hours.

22A Process for independent review panel to be established 

1 The Director-General must, by notice in the Gazette, set out the process by which an independent review panel is to be established to review whether, in developing an import health standard, there has been sufficient regard to the scientific evidence about which a person consulted under section 22(6) has raised a significant concern.

2 The notice required by subsection (1) must cover the following matters:

a the criteria for setting up an independent review panel; and

b how the Director-General will appoint an independent review panel, including the knowledge and experience required for appointees; and

c the procedures to be followed by

i a person eligible to seek a review under subsection (1); and

ii an independent review panel, in undertaking its review; and

d the reporting requirements for an independent review panel.

3 The Director-General must receive any report from an independent review panel and, as soon as is reasonably practicable, determine the issue in dispute after taking into account the findings and recommendations of the independent review panel, giving reasons for that determination.

4 The Director-General must issue a notice under subsection (1) not later than 1July 2008.

a that the goods comply with the requirements specified in an import health standard in force for the goods (or goods of the kind or description to which the goods belong); and

b that there are no discrepancies in the documentation accompanying the goods (or between that documentation and those goods) that suggest that it may be unwise to rely on that documentation; and

c in the case of an organism, that the goods display no symptoms that may be a consequence of harbouring unwanted organisms; and

d that the goods display no signs of harbouring organisms that may be unwanted organisms; and

e there has been no recent change in circumstances, or in the state of knowledge, that makes it unwise to issue a clearance.

28 Restrictions on giving clearances

1 An inspector must not give a biosecurity clearance for goods that are or contain an organism specified in Schedule 2 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 or for a new organism.

1A However, subsection (1) does not prohibit an inspector from giving a biosecurity clearance for goods the importation of which involves, or might involve, an incidentally imported new organism.

2 Where any new organism is an organism for which

a the Authority has given approval for importation into containment in accordance with sections 42 or 45 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996: and

b there is in existence a containment facility approved as meeting the standard set by the Authority; and

c the organism is able to go to that facility,any inspector may authorise that organism to go to that containment facility.

28A Dealing with suspected new organism

1 Any inspector may seize any organism which the inspector has reason to believe may be a new organism.

2 The provisions of sections 116 and 117 apply to any organism seized under subsection (1) as if that organism were unauthorised goods.

3 A chief technical officer may permit an organism seized under this section to be held in the custody of the Director-General for so long as is necessary for the importer to apply to the Authority for a determination under section 26 of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 that the organism is, or is not, a new organism.

4 Where an organism is held in accordance with this section, the estimated costs and expenses of the custody and maintenance of the organism must be paid in advance to the Director-General by the importer.

5 When the Director-General's custody of an organism ceases, the Director-General must calculate the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of holding the organism and, if those actual and reasonable costs

a exceed the amount paid in accordance with subsection (4), the balance of the costs and expenses are recoverable as a debt due to the Crown from the importer:

b are less than the amount paid in accordance with subsection (4), the overpayment must be refunded to the importer.

6 Where any organism held under subsection (3) is declared to be a new organism, the chief technical officer may, either generally or in any particular case, give any reasonable directions as to the disposal of, or any other dealing with, that organism, but must not give a biosecurity clearance for that organism.

28B Biosecurity clearance for certain new organisms and qualifying organisms
Section 28 does not apply to

a a new organism that is subject to a conditional release approval granted under section 38C of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996; or

b a qualifying organism approved for importation for release with controls under section 38I of that Act.

29 Restricted organisms to be contained

1 No person may cause or permit any restricted organism that is in a transitional facility, a biosecurity control area, or a containment facility to leave that facility or area, except

a to proceed, in accordance with the authority of an inspector, to a transitional facility, a biosecurity control area, or a containment facility; or

b in accordance with the authority of an inspector, to be exported from New Zealand.

56 Preparation of national pest management strategy
A Minister or any person may prepare a proposal for a national pest management strategy.

57 Notification of proposal by Minister

1 A Minister may notify, in accordance with section 62, a proposal for a national pest management strategy only if the Minister is of the opinion that

a the benefits of having a pest management strategy or strategies in relation to each organism to which the strategy would apply outweigh the costs, after taking account of the likely consequences of inaction or alternative courses of action; and

b the net benefits of national intervention exceed the net benefits of regional intervention; and

ba where funding proposals for the strategy require persons to meet directly the costs of implementing the strategy,

i the benefits that will accrue to those persons as a group will outweigh the costs; or

ii those persons contribute to the creation, continuance, or exacerbation of the problems proposed to be resolved by the strategy; and

c each organism in respect of which the strategy is under consideration is capable of causing at some time a serious adverse and unintended effect in relation to New Zealand on 1 or more of the following:

i economic well-being; or

ii the viability of threatened species of organisms, the survival and distribution of indigenous plants or animals, or the sustainability of natural and developed ecosystems, ecological processes, and biological diversity; or

iii soil resources or water quality; or

iv human health or enjoyment of the recreational value of the natural environment; or

v the relationship of Maori and their culture and traditions with their ancestral lands, waters, sites, waahi tapu, and taonga; and

d the implementation of the proposed strategy would not be contrary to New Zealand's international obligations.

2 In addition to the requirements in subsection (1), a Minister may notify, in accordance with section 62, a proposal for a national pest management strategy only if the Minister is of the opinion that each organism in respect of which the strategy is under consideration

a is not known to be established in New Zealand, but if the organism were so established, it would have the potential to cause significant economic loss or environmental degradation, or both, and it could be eradicated or effectively managed; or

b is of restricted distribution or abundance, or restricted distribution and abundance, in New Zealand, but the organism has the potential to cause significant economic loss or environmental degradation, or both, and it could be eradicated or effectively managed; or

c is of widespread distribution in all or part of New Zealand and

i effective action in respect of the organism would be impracticable without a national strategy; and

ii the potential economic, social, or environmental damage or loss of not taking action on a national basis would be significant.

58 Request to notify national proposal

1 Any person may, by notice in writing to a Minister whose responsibilities might be adversely affected by an organism, request that Minister to notify in accordance with section 62 a proposal for a national pest management strategy in relation to that organism.

99A Funding powers of regional councils for national pest management strategies
The powers of a regional council under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 to set and assess rates for the purpose of exercising any of the powers conferred on it by this Act in relation to national pest management strategies, or for the purpose of exercising any of the powers conferred on it by section13(1)(f) or section 100 of this Act, are not limited or affected by

a section 97; or

b section 6 of the Biosecurity Amendment Act 1994.

99B Limitation on expenditure
A management agency must not spend funds to meet the costs of implementing a pest management strategy in contravention of the limitations, if any, imposed on the expenditure of funds by the strategy.



100 Regional council may without pest management strategy undertake small-scale management of unwanted organisms

1 If satisfied that

a an unwanted organism that is present in the region could cause serious adverse and unintended effects unless early action to control it is taken; and

b the organism can be eradicated or controlled effectively by small-scale measures within 3 years of commencing measures to control the organism, because

i distribution of the organism is limited; and

ii technical means to control the organism are available; and

c the taking of all the measures (including the payment of any amount to a person for the purpose of compensating that person for a loss) is likely to cost less than an amount for the time being prescribed for the purposes of this section by the Governor-General by Order in Council; and

d the taking of those measures is unlikely to result in significant monetary loss to any person, other than a person who has contributed to the presence or spread of the organism by failing to comply with this Act or any pest management strategy,a regional council may, by giving such public notice as the regional council thinks fit having regard to the distribution of the unwanted organism and the persons likely to be affected by the measures taken, declare a small-scale management programme.

2 Every public notice declaring a small-scale management programme must specify

a the unwanted organism that is the subject of the small-scale management programme; and

b the objectives of the small-scale management programme; and

c the powers to be exercised in accordance with section 55 to implement the small-scale management programme.

3 Before any powers to enter a place and carry out work are exercised in accordance with a small-scale management programme, a notice specifying the matters in subsection (2) and the work to be carried out on the place must be given to the occupier of the place not less than 5 working days before the work is carried out.

4 Subsection (3) does not apply where the regional council is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the unwanted organism may spread beyond the place before the expiry of 5 working days.

5 A small-scale management programme ceases to have effect

a when the regional council declares by public notice that the programme is failing to control the organism; or

b when the regional council declares by public notice that the organism has been eradicated or brought under control; or

c after the expiry of 5 years from the declaration of the programme.

100A Exercise of powers in respect of unwanted organism

1 The powers under Part 6 in relation to an unwanted organism may be exercised by

a the Director-General:

b a chief technical officer appointed by the Director-General, or the chief executive of any department:

c an inspector or authorised person appointed under section 103(1)(a):

d an inspector or authorised person appointed under section 103(2)(a).

2 Where a small-scale management programme has been declared under section 100 by a regional council in respect of an organism, that declaration does not prevent the exercise of Part 6 powers by the persons specified in subsection (1) in relation to that organism.

132 Road blocks, cordons, checkpoints, etc

1 In this section, *control* means a road block, a cordon, or a checkpoint.
