14 Remedies for failure to reregister

1 Where a company is deemed to have been reregistered in accordance with section 13 or section 13A or section 13B, any person who, immediately before that reregistration, was a member of the company may apply to the court for an order under this section.

2 On any application under this section, the court may, if it is satisfied that the applicant has been prejudiced as a result of the reregistration, make such order as it thinks fit, including, without limiting the generality of this subsection, an order

a requiring the company or any other person to acquire the applicant's shares; or

b requiring the company or any other person to pay compensation to the applicant; or

c regulating the future conduct of the company's affairs; or

d putting the company into liquidation.

3 An application under this section must be made within 2 years after the end of the transition period in relation to the company.

4 In making an order under subsection (2)(b), the court must have regard to

a the extent of the loss or damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the company having been deemed to have been reregistered; and

b the extent to which the person against whom the order is sought was responsible for the failure of the company to make an application for reregistration to the Registrar.

5 The court must not put the company into liquidation if

a it considers that the applicant has acted unreasonably in seeking to have the company put into liquidation; or

b the company resolves, prior to the hearing of the application, to adopt a constitution or to amend its constitution and the court is satisfied that under the constitution or the constitution as amended the applicant will no longer be prejudiced; or

c an order for the payment of compensation under subsection (2)(b) would adequately compensate the applicant.

6 If the court makes an order putting the company into liquidation, the liquidation shall be in accordance with the Companies Act 1955 as if the company had not been reregistered under the Companies Act 1993 but had remained registered under the Companies Act 1955 with the same memorandum of association and articles of association as it had at the close of the transition period.

7 No order may be made against the company under this section unless the company is a party to the proceedings in which the application is made.

8 In this section, the term *member* includes a reference to a personal representative of a member, and a person to whom shares of a member have passed by operation of law.

15 Reduction of member's liability on reregistration

1 Where, by reason of the reregistration of an existing company, the liability of a member of the company,

a in respect of any share held by that member prior to that reregistration; or

b in the case of an unlimited company or a company limited by guarantee, under an undertaking to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up,is cancelled or reduced, the cancellation or reduction of that liability shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a distribution of the amount by which that liability is reduced made to that person in his or her capacity as a shareholder in the company on its reregistration.

2 A distribution may be recovered from a shareholder if, immediately after reregistration, the company was unable to pay its debts, including contingent debts, as they became due in the normal course of business unless,

a on the reregistration of the company, the shareholder had no knowledge that the company was unable to so pay its debts; and

b the shareholder has altered the shareholder's position in reliance on the validity of the distribution; and

c it would be unfair to require repayment in full or at all.

3 A distribution may be recovered from a director, if immediately after reregistration, the company was unable to pay its debts, including contingent debts, as they became due in the normal course of business.

4 If, in an action against a shareholder under this section, the court is satisfied that the liability of that person could properly have been reduced by a lesser amount without resulting in the company being unable to pay its debts, the court may allow that person to retain an amount equal to the value of the distribution that could properly have been made.

5 If, in an action against a director under this section, the court is satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the liability of the shareholder could properly have been reduced by the amount of the distribution or a lesser amount without resulting in the company being unable to pay its debts, the court may relieve the director from liability in respect of that amount or lesser amount, as the case may be.

6 The amount that may be recovered from a director is limited to the amount that is not able to be recovered from a shareholder under subsection (2).

b having voted in favour of a resolution referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 6, fails to sign a certificate in accordance with paragraph (c) of that subsection,commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

2 Where a company fails to comply with section 10(4), the company and every director of the company commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.

3 It is a defence to a director charged with an offence against subsection (2) if the director proves that

a the company took all reasonable and proper steps to ensure that the requirements of section 10(4) would be complied with; or

b he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure that the company complied with the requirements of that subsection; or
