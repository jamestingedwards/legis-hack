b recognise that disputes about compliance with Part 1A or Part 2 are more likely to be successfully resolved if those disputes can be resolved promptly by the parties themselves; and

d recognise that the procedures for dispute resolution under this Part need to be flexible; and

e recognise that judicial intervention at the lowest level needs to be that of a specialist decision-making body that is not inhibited by strict procedural requirements; and

76 Functions of Commission under this Part

1 The primary functions of the Commission under this Part are

a to provide information to members of the public who have questions about discrimination; and

b to facilitate the resolution of disputes about compliance with Part 1A or Part 2, by the parties concerned, in the most efficient, informal, and cost-effective manner possible.

79 How complaints received to be treated

1 This section applies if the Commission receives, under section 76(2)(a), a complaint alleging that there has been a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or both Parts.

2 If the complaint or part of it concerns an enactment, or an act or omission that is authorised or required by an enactment, the complaint or relevant part of it must be treated only as a complaint that the enactment is in breach of Part 1A.

3 Despite every other provision of this section, if the complaint or part of it concerns a judgment or other order of a court, or an act or omission of a court affecting the conduct of any proceedings, the Commission must take no further action in relation to the complaint or relevant part of it.

4 If the complaint or part of it concerns an act or omission by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) applies, the complaint or relevant part of it

i is unlawful under any of sections 22, 23, 61 to 63, and 66; or

ii is unlawful under any of sections 65 and 67 to 74, but only to the extent that those sections relate to conduct that is unlawful under any provision referred to in subparagraph (i):

5 If the complaint or relevant part of it concerns a breach of Part 2, and none of subsections (2) to (4) applies to the complaint or relevant part of it, the complaint or relevant part of it must be treated only as a complaint that there has been a breach of the relevant provision or provisions of Part 2.

6 Nothing in this section prevents the Commission from involving any person that it considers appropriate in information gathering and the resolution of disputes.

1 If the circumstances giving rise to a complaint under Part 2 are such that an employee would also be entitled to pursue a personal grievance under the Employment Relations Act 2000, the employee may take 1, but not both, of the following steps:

a the employee may make in relation to those circumstances a complaint under this Act:

b the employee may, if the grievance is not otherwise resolved, apply to the Employment Relations Authority for the resolution of the grievance under the Employment Relations Act 2000.

2 To avoid doubt, a complaint referred to in subsection (1) includes, but is not limited to, a complaint about sexual harassment or racial harassment.

3 For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), an employee makes a complaint when proceedings about that complaint are commenced by the complainant or the Commission.

4 If an employee makes a complaint under subsection (1)(a), the employee may not exercise or continue to exercise any rights relating to the subject matter of the complaint that the employee may have under the Employment Relations Act 2000.

3 The Commission may also decline to take action or further action under this Part in relation to a complaint if, in the Commission's opinion,

b the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good faith; or

c having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is unnecessary to take further action in relation to the complaint; or

d there is in all the circumstances an adequate remedy or right of appeal, other than the right to petition Parliament or to make a complaint to the Ombudsman, that it would be reasonable for the complainant or the person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) to exercise.

4 If the Commission decides to take no action or no further action in relation to a complaint, it must inform the complainant or the person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) and the person against whom the complaint is made

a by the Director for a complainant, aggrieved person, group of persons, or party to a settlement of a complaint; and

b in accordance with a decision of the Director under section 90(1)(a) or (c).

4 The Office of Human Rights Proceedings must pay any award of costs made against a person in proceedings for which representation is provided for that person by the Director.

5 Any award of costs made in favour of a person in proceedings for which representation is provided for that person by the Director must be paid to the Office of Human Rights Proceedings.

6 Nothing in this Act limits or affects the entitlement to legal aid (if any) of a party in respect of proceedings or intended proceedings (whether or not representation for the party in the proceedings may, or is to be, is being, or has been, provided in accordance with a decision of the Director under section 90(1)(a) or (c)).

92D Tribunal may refer complaint back to Commission, or adjourn proceedings to seek resolution by settlement

1 When proceedings under section 92B are brought, the Tribunal

a must (whether through a member or officer) first consider whether an attempt has been made to resolve the complaint (whether through mediation or otherwise); and

b must refer the complaint under section 76(2)(a) to which the proceedings relate back to the Commission unless the Tribunal is satisfied that attempts at resolution, or further attempts at resolution, of the complaint by the parties and the Commission

i will not contribute constructively to resolving the complaint; or

ii will not, in the circumstances, be in the public interest; or

iii will undermine the urgent or interim nature of the proceedings.

2 The Tribunal may, at any time before, during, or after the hearing of proceedings, refer a complaint under section 76(2)(a) back to the Commission if it appears to the Tribunal, from what is known to it about the complaint, that the complaint may yet be able to be resolved by the parties and the Commission (for example, by mediation).

3 The Tribunal may, instead of exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), adjourn any proceedings relating to a complaint under section 76(2)(a) for a specified period if it appears to the Tribunal, from what is known about the complaint, that the complaint may yet be able to be resolved by the parties.

92E Civil proceedings arising from inquiry by Commission

1 If the Commission considers that an inquiry by it under section 5(2)(h) has disclosed or may have disclosed a breach of a kind referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c), it may bring civil proceedings before the Tribunal,

b for a breach of Part 1A that is an enactment, or an act or omission authorised or required by an enactment or otherwise by law, against the Attorney-General, or against a person or body referred to in section 3(b) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 alleged to be responsible for the breach:

c for a breach of Part 2, against the person or persons alleged to be responsible for the breach.

2 The Commission may exercise the right in subsection (1) only if it considers that the exercise of the right will facilitate the performance of its functions stated in section 5(2)(a).

3 This section does not limit section 6 or section 92H or section 97.

92F Proof of justified limits and exceptions

1 The onus of proving, in any proceedings under this Part, that an act or omission is, under section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, a justified limit on the right to freedom from discrimination affirmed by section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 lies on the defendant.

2 The onus of proving, in any proceedings under this Part, that conduct is, under any provision of Part 2, excepted from conduct that is unlawful under any provision of Part 2 lies on the defendant.

92G Right of Attorney-General to appear in civil proceedings

3 If, under subsection (1), the Commission appears in any proceedings of a kind described in that subsection, it has, unless those proceedings are by way of appeal, the right to adduce evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses.

4 This section is not limited by section 92B or section 92E or section 97.



92I Remedies

1 This section is subject to sections 92J and 92K (which relate to the only remedy that may be granted by the Tribunal if it finds that an enactment is in breach of Part 1A).

2 In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the plaintiff may seek any of the remedies described in subsection (3) that the plaintiff thinks fit.

3 If, in proceedings referred to in subsection (2), the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, the Tribunal may grant 1 or more of the following remedies:

a a declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint:

b an order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order:

c damages in accordance with sections 92M to 92O:

d an order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach:

e a declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any provision of Part 1A or Part 2 is an illegal contract:

f an order that the defendant undertake any specified training or any other programme, or implement any specified policy or programme, in order to assist or enable the defendant to comply with the provisions of this Act:

g relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties:

h any other relief the Tribunal thinks fit.

4 It is no defence to proceedings referred to in subsection (2) or subsection (5) that the breach was unintentional or without negligence on the part of the party against whom the complaint was made, but, subject to section 92P, the Tribunal must take the conduct of the parties into account in deciding what, if any, remedy to grant.

5 In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought, under section 92B(3), by the person against whom a complaint was made, that person may seek a declaration that he or she has not committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2.

92J Remedy for enactments in breach of Part 1A

1 If, in proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal, the Tribunal finds that an enactment is in breach of Part 1A, the only remedy that the Tribunal may grant is the declaration referred to in subsection (2).

2 The declaration that may be granted by the Tribunal, if subsection (1) applies, is a declaration that the enactment that is the subject of the finding is inconsistent with the right to freedom from discrimination affirmed by section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

3 The Tribunal may not grant a declaration under subsection (2) unless that decision has the support of all or a majority of the members of the Tribunal.

4 Nothing in this section affects the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

92K Effect of declaration

1 A declaration under section 92J does not

a affect the validity, application, or enforcement of the enactment in respect of which it is given; or

b prevent the continuation of the act, omission, policy, or activity that was the subject of the complaint.

2 If a declaration is made under section 92J and that declaration is not overturned on appeal or the time for lodging an appeal expires, the Minister for the time being responsible for the administration of the enactment must present to the House of Representatives

a a report bringing the declaration to the attention of the House of Representatives; and

b a report containing advice on the Government's response to the declaration.

3 The Minister referred to in subsection (2) must carry out the duties imposed on the Minister by that subsection within 120 days of the date of disposal of all appeals against the granting of the declaration or, if no appeal is lodged, the date when the time for lodging an appeal expires.

92L Costs

1 In any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E or section 97, the Tribunal may make any award as to costs that it thinks fit, whether or not it grants any other remedy.

2 Without limiting the matters that the Tribunal may consider in determining whether to make an award of costs under this section, the Tribunal may take into account whether, and to what extent, any party to the proceedings

a has participated in good faith in the process of information gathering by the Commission:

b has facilitated or obstructed that information-gathering process:

c has acted in a manner that facilitated the resolution of the issues that were the subject of the proceedings.

92M Damages

1 In any proceedings under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the Tribunal may award damages against the defendant for a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint in respect of any 1 or more of the following:

a pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction or activity out of which the breach arose:

b loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, that the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach:

c humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person.

2 This section applies subject to sections 92J, 92N, and 92O of this Act and to subpart 1 of Part 2 of the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005.

92N Directions as to payment of damages in certain cases

1 If the plaintiff is a minor who is not married or in a civil union, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust or to a person or trustee corporation acting as the manager of any property of the plaintiff.

2 If the plaintiff is a mentally disordered person within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 whose property is not being managed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988, but who lacks, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs in relation to his or her own property, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust.

3 If the plaintiff is a person whose property is being managed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988, the Tribunal must ascertain whether the terms of the property order cover management of money received as damages and,

a if damages fall within the terms of the property order, the Tribunal must direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to the person or trustee corporation acting as the property manager; or

b if damages do not fall within the terms of the property order, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust.

4 If money is paid to Public Trust under any of subsections (1) to (3),

a section 12 of the Minors' Contracts Act 1969 applies in the case of a minor who is not married or in a civil union; and

b sections 108D, 108F, and 108G of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 apply, with any necessary modifications, in the case of a person referred to in subsection (2) or subsection (3)(b) of this section; and

c section 108E of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 applies, with any necessary modifications, in the case of a person referred to in subsection (3)(a) of this section.

92O Tribunal may defer or modify remedies for breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or terms of settlement

1 If, in any proceedings under this Part, the Tribunal determines that an act or omission is in breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, it may, on the application of any party to the proceedings, take 1 or more of the actions stated in subsection (2).

2 The actions are,

a instead of, or as well as, awarding damages or granting any other remedy,

i to specify a period during which the defendant must remedy the breach; and

ii to adjourn the proceedings to a specified date to enable further consideration of the remedies or further remedies (if any) to be granted:

b to refuse to grant any remedy that has retrospective effect:

c to refuse to grant any remedy in respect of an act or omission that occurred before the bringing of proceedings or the date of the determination of the Tribunal or any other date specified by the Tribunal:

d to provide that any remedy granted has effect only prospectively or only from a date specified by the Tribunal:

e to provide that the retrospective effect of any remedy is limited in a way specified by the Tribunal.

92P Matters to be taken into account in exercising powers given by section 92O

1 In determining whether to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O, the Tribunal must take account of the following matters:

a whether or not the defendant in the proceedings has acted in good faith:

b whether or not the interests of any person or body not represented in the proceedings would be adversely affected if 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O is, or is not, taken:

c whether or not the proceedings involve a significant issue that has not previously been considered by the Tribunal:

d the social and financial implications of granting any remedy sought by the plaintiff:

e the significance of the loss or harm suffered by any person as a result of the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint:

f the public interest generally:

g any other matter that the Tribunal considers relevant.

2 If the Tribunal finds that an act or omission is in breach of Part 1A or that an act or omission by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 is in breach of Part 2, in determining whether to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O, the Tribunal must, in addition to the matters specified in subsection (1), take account of

a the requirements of fair public administration; and

b the obligation of the Government to balance competing demands for the expenditure of public money.



92Q Monetary limits on remedies Tribunal may grant

1 Proceedings under section 92B or section 92E may be brought before the Human Rights Review Tribunal irrespective of the amount of damages claimed or the value of the property in respect of which any remedy is sought.

2 However, except as provided in sections 92R to 92V, the Tribunal must not award any damages or grant any remedy in any proceedings of that kind if the making of that award or the granting of that remedy would, because of the monetary limits contained in sections 29 to 34 of the District Courts Act 1947, be beyond the jurisdiction of a District Court.

3 For the purposes of subsection (2), if civil proceedings under section 92B are brought on behalf of more than 1 complainant or, as the case may be, more than 1 aggrieved person, those proceedings must, for the purpose of applying any monetary limit under subsection (2), be treated as if each complainant or, as the case may be, each aggrieved person on whose behalf those proceedings are brought, were the plaintiff in a separate action against the defendant.



92R Tribunal to refer granting of remedies to High Court
The Human Rights Review Tribunal must refer the granting of a remedy in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to the High Court if the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a defendant in the proceedings has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, but that

a the granting of the appropriate remedy under section 92I would be outside the limits imposed by section 92Q; or

b that the granting of a remedy in those proceedings would be better dealt with by the High Court.

92S Further provisions on reference to High Court

1 A reference under section 92R is made by sending, to the Registrar of the High Court nearest to where the proceedings were commenced, a report on the proceedings that

a sets out the Tribunal's finding with regard to the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint; and

b includes, or is accompanied by, a statement of the considerations to which the Tribunal has had regard in making the reference to that Court.

2 A copy of the report must be given or sent promptly to every party to the proceedings.

3 Except as provided in this Act, the procedure for a reference under section 92R is the same as the procedure prescribed by rules of court in respect of appeals, and those rules apply with all necessary modifications.

92T High Court decides remedies on reference from Tribunal

1 This section applies where the granting of a remedy in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E is referred to the High Court under section 92R.

2 The High Court may direct the Tribunal to amplify any report made under section 92S(1).

3 Every person who, under section 92S(2), is given or sent a copy of a report under section 92S(1) is entitled to be heard and to tender in the High Court evidence as to the remedy (if any) to be granted on the basis of the Tribunal's finding that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint.

4 However, no person referred to in subsection (3) may, on the reference under section 92R, challenge the finding of the Tribunal referred to in subsection (3).

5 The High Court must decide, on the basis of the Tribunal's finding that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2, whether 1 or more of the remedies set out in section 92I or the remedy set out in section 92J is to be granted.

92U High Court's decision on remedies to be included in, and given effect to as part of, Tribunal's determination

1 Every decision of the High Court under section 92T(5)

a must be remitted to the Tribunal for inclusion in its determination with regard to the proceedings; and

b has effect as part of that determination despite the limits imposed by section 92Q.

2 Nothing in subsection (1)

a limits sections 123 to 125; or

b prevents the making of an appeal in accordance with section 123 in respect of a determination of the Tribunal in which a decision of the High Court is included in accordance with subsection (1)(a).



92V Abandonment to enable Tribunal to make award of damages

1 This section applies where the Tribunal would have jurisdiction in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to make an award of damages in accordance with section 92M if the amount of the award were within the limit for the time being fixed by section 29(1) of the District Courts Act 1947 (as applied by section 92Q(2)).

2 The Tribunal may make an award within that limit if the plaintiff abandons the excess.

3 An award of damages in those proceedings in accordance with section 92M operates to discharge from liability in respect of the amount abandoned in that way any person against whom the proceedings are brought and the subsequent award is made.

4 This section overrides sections 92Q to 92U.

92W Extension of jurisdiction by agreement between parties

1 If, in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E, only section 92Q prevents the Tribunal from granting any 1 or more of the remedies stated in section 92I, and the parties to the proceedings, by memorandum signed by them or their respective solicitors or agents, agree that the Tribunal is to have jurisdiction to grant any 1 or more of those remedies irrespective of section 92Q, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant 1 or more of those remedies accordingly.

2 This section overrides sections 92Q to 92U.

e the Tribunal is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances, the High Court should determine the proceedings or matter.

3 Despite subsection (2), if the validity of any regulation is questioned in proceedings before the Tribunal and the leave of the High Court is obtained for the making of an order under this section, the Tribunal must make an order under this section.

4 If the Tribunal declines to remove proceedings, or a matter at issue in them, to the High Court (whether as a result of the refusal of the High Court to grant leave or otherwise), the party applying for the removal may seek the special leave of the High Court for an order of the High Court that the proceedings or matter be removed to the High Court and, in determining whether to grant an order of that kind, the High Court must apply the criteria stated in subsection (2)(a) to (d).
