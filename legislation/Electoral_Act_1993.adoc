b at any other time directed by the Chief Registrar.

3 In any year in which a triennial general election of members of any local authority must be held under the Local Electoral Act 2001, every Registrar of a district that is, in part or in whole, within the local government area of a local authority must direct an inquiry to be made concerning the particulars on the roll of every person who

a the Registrar must ensure that the form or the information contained in the form, or the information supplied electronically, is transmitted to the Registrar for the new electoral district; and

b the Registrar for the new electoral district must, as if the form or the information supplied electronically were an application for registration, register that elector, in accordance with section 87, on the roll for the district in which the elector resides; and

c the form or the information supplied electronically is deemed to be an application for registration for the purposes of section 82; and

d the Registrar for the old electoral district must, in accordance with section 98(1)(a), remove from the roll for that district the name of the elector.

2 If, following an inquiry under section 83, the Registrar receives from an elector a form, or information supplied electronically under subsection(3), that contains a change to any particulars other than a change of place of residence referred to in subsection(1), the Registrar must amend the roll in accordance with the information supplied in the form or electronically.

3 An elector may, instead of returning a form to the Registrar to notify the Registrar that the elector has changed his or her place of residence and now resides in another electoral district or to notify the Registrar of a change to any other of the elector's particulars, notify the Registrar of a change to any of the elector's particulars by supplying that information to the Registrar using an electronic medium approved for the purpose by the Chief Registrar.

5 A form that a person intends to return, or returns, in response to an inquiry under section 83 must be signed or marked, and may be rejected for incompleteness, in accordance with subsections (1), (2), and (4) of section 85 (which apply with all necessary modifications) as if the form were an application or declaration in respect of registration as an elector.

6 Information that an elector intends to supply, or supplies, electronically under subsection(3) in response to an inquiry under section 83

a is not an application or declaration in respect of registration as an elector required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 85 to be signed or marked; but

b may be rejected for incompleteness under section 85(4) (which applies with all necessary modifications) if it does not include all the particulars stated or referred to in section 85(3)(a), (b), (c), (f), and (i).

83B No form of inquiry required if application for registration as elector received
If the Registrar receives, during an inquiry under section 83(1), or within 28 days before the commencement of an inquiry under that section, a duly completed application for registration as an elector, or information supplied electronically to make an application for registration as an elector under section 82(1)(c) and (4A),

a that application is deemed to be a completed form for the purposes of section 83; and

b the Registrar must notify that elector that he or she will not receive a form of inquiry under section 83.

83C Elector who cannot be contacted to be included in dormant roll

1 This section applies if

a the Registrar is notified that an inquiry made under section 83(1) or a form sent under section 78(2) cannot be delivered to the elector to whom it is addressed because the whereabouts of the elector are not known; or

b at any other time the elector cannot be contacted at the electors address on the roll.

2 If this section applies, the Registrar must

a make any inquiry as to the whereabouts of the elector that the Registrar thinks fit or that the Chief Registrar directs; and

b if the Registrar is then unable to contact the elector, the Registrar must remove the name of the elector from the roll and include the name in the dormant roll maintained under section 109.

83D Transfer of electors between electorates

1 This section applies if a Registrar has received advice under section 82(1)(c) or otherwise that an elector has changed his or her place of residence and now resides in an electoral district other than the district in respect of which the elector is registered.

2 If the Registrar who receives the advice referred to in subsection (1) is the Registrar of the electoral district in which the elector now resides (the *new Registrar*), the new Registrar must inform the Registrar of the electoral district in respect of which the elector is registered (the *old Registrar*) of that information.

3 If the old Registrar believes that at least 1 month has elapsed since the change in the electors place of residence, the old Registrar must send the elector a request for confirmation of the electors new place of residence.

4 A request under subsection (3) must be in the prescribed form and must contain

a the particulars of the enrolment of the elector to whom it is addressed; and

b the address of the electors new place of residence; and

c provision for the elector to make changes to the information in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b).

5 An elector who receives a form under this section must, within the time stated by the Registrar, sign the form and return it to the old Registrar.

6 If the old Registrar receives a form returned under subsection(5),

a the old Registrar must ensure that the form, or the information contained in the form, is transmitted to the new Registrar; and

b the new Registrar must, as if the form were an application for registration, register that elector, in accordance with section 87, on the roll for the district in which the elector resides; and

c the form is deemed to be an application for registration for the purposes of section 82; and

d the old Registrar must, in accordance with section98(1)(a), remove from his or her roll the name of the elector.

7 Nothing in this section applies if the Registrar under section 83A(1) receives a form or information supplied electronically under section 83A(3) in which an elector notifies the Registrar that the elector has changed his or her place of residence and now resides in another electoral district.

87A Procedure if immigration status means applicant apparently not qualified to be registered

1 This section applies in accordance with section 263A(6)(a) if the Chief Registrar under section 263A(5) advises the Registrar of an electoral district that a comparison carried out pursuant to section263A(4) indicates that a person who has applied to be (but is not yet) registered as an elector of the electoral district is a person who the chief executive of the responsible department (as defined in section 263A(1)) believes is

a unlawfully in New Zealand; or

b a person who is lawfully in New Zealand but only by virtue of being the holder of a temporary entry class visa of whatever type.

2 When this section applies the Registrar must comply with subsections (3) to (5) before determining under section 87 whether the applicant for registration as an elector is qualified to be registered.

3 The Registrar must within 5 working days of receiving that advice deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice (in this section referred to as a or the *notice*) communicating

a the advice that the Registrar received under section 263A(5) in respect of the applicant; and

b that the Registrar may determine that the applicant's immigration status means that the applicant is not qualified to be registered as an elector if information to the contrary is not made available to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5working days after the applicant receives the notice.

4 If no response to the notice is made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 10working days of the notice being delivered to the applicant personally, or sent by post to that person, the Registrar must promptly deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice (in this section referred to as a or the *further notice*) communicating

a the advice that the Registrar received under section 263A(5) in respect of the applicant; and

b the fact that, and the date on which, a notice was delivered to the applicant personally, or sent by post to that person; and

c that the Registrar may determine that the applicant's immigration status means that the applicant is not qualified to be registered as an elector if information to the contrary is not made available to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5working days after the applicant receives the further notice.

5 The Registrar may determine under section 87 whether the applicant for registration as an elector is qualified to be registered only

a after considering any response to the notice or a further notice made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5 working days after the notice or a further notice was delivered to the applicant personally, or received by that person by post; or

b if no response to a further notice is made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 10 working days of the further notice being delivered personally to the applicant, or received by that person by post.

6 A notice or further notice purportedly sent to the applicant by post

a is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, treated as having been received by that person by post on the fourth working day after the day on which it is sent by post; and

b is treated as sent by post to that person on a day if it is proved to have been properly addressed to that person and to have been submitted on that day to a person for the time being registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998 for postage to that person.

7 If, after complying with subsections (3) to (5), the Registrar determines under section 87 that the applicant for registration as an elector is not qualified to be registered, the Registrar must deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice communicating the determination.

191 Election of other members

1 When the Electoral Commission has received from all Returning Officers the information required by section 179(1) to be forwarded to the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Commission must proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names have been included in party lists submitted pursuant to section 127 have been elected.

2 The Electoral Commission must first ascertain from the information given under section 179(1)(a) the total number of all the party votes received by each of the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

3 The Electoral Commission must enter those totals in separate columns under the name of each party in a working sheet in the manner prescribed in form 15.

4 The Electoral Commission must disregard any total under the name of any party that

a has not achieved a total that is at least 5% of the total number of all the party votes received by all the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote; and

b is a party in respect of which no constituency candidate who is either

i a candidate for that party; or

ii a candidate for a component party of that party (being a component party that is not listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote but is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party)has had his or her name endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament.

4A Where the Electoral Commission disregards the name of a party in accordance with subsection (4), that party shall, for the purpose of this section and sections 192 and 193, be deemed to have been deleted from the list of parties included in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

5 The Electoral Commission must then proceed to divide each of the remaining totals successively by a series of numbers beginning with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and thereafter by every odd number as may be necessary to ensure that the number of seats required to be allocated by this section and sections 192 and 193 are allocated.

6 The quotient of each successive division shall be recorded on the working sheet.

7 Once the quotient of each successive division is entered on the working sheet, the Electoral Commission must then proceed to ascertain from a comparison of all the figures in the working sheet in form 15 listed under the heading Quotients of divisions, the highest 120 quotients or such lower number as is required by subsection (8).

8 If any person whose name is endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament, is

a an independent; or

b a member of a political party that did not appear on the list of parties in that part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote (not being a political party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of a political party that did appear on that list),the Electoral Commission must, for the purposes of applying subsection (7), deduct from the number of 120 the number of any such persons.

9 In any case where the lowest of the numbers required to be ascertained under subsection (7) constitutes 2 or more numbers in different columns which are of exactly the same value, the Electoral Commission must determine by lot which of those numbers is to be selected for the purpose of subsection(7).

10 The Electoral Commission, having ascertained the numbers required by subsection (7), must cause a circle to be drawn on the working sheet around each of those numbers.

192 Determination of party eligibility for list seats

1 Having ascertained the numbers required by section 191(7), the Electoral Commission must then proceed to ascertain the number of seats in Parliament to which each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote is entitled by adding the number of circles in the column of numbers under the name of that party.

2 Subject to subsection (3), the Electoral Commission must then proceed, in respect of each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote, to deduct from the number of seats to which each party is entitled under subsection (1)

a the number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for that party and whose names were endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as having been elected as members of Parliament; and

b the number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for a party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party and whose names were endorsed on a writ pursuant to section 185 as having been elected as members of Parliament.

3 The deduction described in subsection (2)(b) shall not be made in respect of constituency seats gained by a component party that is listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

4 Subject to subsection (5), after the process of deduction described in subsection (2) has been completed in respect of each party, the remainder derived therefrom shall be the number of seats to be allocated to that party from the list of candidates submitted pursuant to section 127.

5 If any party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote has obtained, through the election of any of its constituency candidates or any of the constituency candidates for any party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party or both, a number of seats that is equal to or greater than the total number of seats in Parliament to which it would be entitled under subsection (1), that party shall not be allocated any seats from the list of candidates submitted by that party pursuant to section 127, but the seats of the constituency candidates of that party who have been elected as members of Parliament shall not be affected.

193 Selection of candidates

1 Upon completing the procedures outlined in section 192, the Electoral Commission must proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names appear on the list submitted pursuant to section 127 by each of the parties listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote are entitled to be elected.

2 The Electoral Commission must determine which candidates are entitled to be elected by selecting those candidates on the list of each party, beginning with the first candidate on the list and ending with the lowest ranking candidate, which are equal in number to the number of seats to which that party is entitled to have allocated from its list submitted pursuant to section127.

3 In performing the duties required by subsection (2), the Electoral Commission must disregard the name of any candidate whose name has been endorsed on the writ pursuant to section185, and the name of that candidate shall be deemed to have been deleted from the list submitted pursuant to section127.

4 Where all the candidates appearing on a list submitted by a party pursuant to section 127 are entitled to be selected, no further candidates for that party may be selected, notwithstanding that the party may be entitled to a greater number of seats than the number of candidates appearing on that list and those seats shall not be filled.

5 The Electoral Commission must, as soon as practicable after selecting the names of those candidates entitled to be elected,

a declare those candidates to be elected by publishing in the Gazette the full names of the members elected; and

b forward to the Clerk of the House of Representatives a return listing the names of the members elected.

6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any provision of sections 191 and 192, the Electoral Commission may proceed to select the names of those candidates entitled to be elected from lists submitted under section 127, by such method and procedure as the Electoral Commission thinks fit, including the use of computer technology:provided that, before declaring any candidates to be elected under subsection (5), the Electoral Commission shall complete the procedures required by sections 191 and 192 and this section.

7 In completing the procedures required by sections 191 and 192 and this section, the Electoral Commission may use such assistants as the Electoral Commission considers necessary.
