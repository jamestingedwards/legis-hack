ii A ballot paper that does not clearly indicate the constituency candidate or the party, as the case may require, for which the voter desired to vote:Provided that no ballot paper or part of the ballot paper shall be rejected as informal by reason only of some informality in the manner in which it or any other part of the ballot paper has been dealt with by the voter if the ballot paper or part of the ballot paper being considered is otherwise regular, and if, in the opinion of the Returning Officer, the intention of the voter is clearly indicated:Provided also that no ballot paper or part of a ballot paper shall be rejected as informal by reason only of some error or omission on the part of an official, if the Returning Officer is satisfied that the voter was qualified to vote at the election:

b The Returning Officer shall then

i Count, as the case may require, the number of votes received by each party or the number of votes received by each constituency candidate or both; and

5A Despite section 60, if a voter who was qualified to vote as an elector of a particular district votes as if he or she were an elector of another district, the voter's party vote

a may not be disallowed simply because of the voter's error with regard to the district; and

b for the purposes of this section and sections 179 to 181, is to be regarded as having been cast by an elector of the other district.

6 The ballot papers from all the parcels shall be dealt with in the manner aforesaid and the ballot papers from one parcel may be so dealt with while those from another parcel or parcels are also being so dealt with.

7 The ballot papers of special voters shall be dealt with in like manner, after which they shall be made up together into a parcel which shall be properly secured and shall be endorsed in the manner hereinbefore described.

8 When all the ballot papers have been dealt with in the prescribed manner, the Justice attending shall sign a certificate stating the total number of ballot papers used at the election, the number of votes received by each party or constituency candidate, as the case may require, and the number of informal votes, and that certificate shall be preserved by the Returning Officer for production when required.

9 Where at any count of the ballot papers under this section counting of the ballot papers extends beyond one day, the Justice attending shall give his or her certificate day by day showing the progress of that counting and describing the parcels counted in his or her presence.

2 Every application under subsection (1) of this section must be made within 3 working days after the date of the last public declaration made under section 179 of this Act for any electoral district.

3 Every application under subsection (1) of this section shall be accompanied by a deposit of $90,000 (which deposit shall be inclusive of goods and services tax).

4 The Chief District Court Judge shall cause a separate recount of the party votes to be conducted for each electoral district and, for that purpose, shall, within 3 working days after receiving the application for the recounts, arrange, in respect of each recount, for a District Court Judge to conduct it.

5 Each recount conducted under this section shall be conducted in accordance with subsections (5) to (10) of section 180 of this Act, except that each recount shall be commenced within 3 working days of the date on which the District Court Judge conducting the recount is assigned that task.

6 At the conclusion of all recounts under this section, the Chief District Court Judge may make such order or orders as to the costs of and incidental to those recounts as the Chief District Court Judge thinks just, and, subject to any such order, shall direct that the deposit made under this section be returned to the person who paid it.

182 Ability to combine recounts
Nothing in section 180 or section 181 of this Act requires the electorate votes or the party votes to be the subject of more than one recount and, where more than one application is received that would involve recounts of the same votes or of both parts of the same ballot papers, those applications may be combined by the District Court Judge conducting the recount.

183 Scrutineers for recounts and allocation of list seats

1 Any constituency candidate affected by an application under section 180(1) of this Act for a recount of electorate votes in an electoral district may appoint one or more scrutineers to be present at the recount.

2 Any political party affected

a By an application under section 180(2) of this Act for a recount of party votes in an electoral district; or

b By an application under section 181(1) of this Act for recounts of the party votes in every electoral district,may appoint one or more scrutineers to be present at any such recount.

5 Where a political party appoints more than one scrutineer to be present during the allocation of list seats, only one scrutineer for that political party, or such greater number as is permitted by the Chief Electoral Officer, shall be present at any one time.

6 No candidate shall act as a scrutineer under this section.

7 A scrutineer appointed under this section may be appointed by facsimile transmission.

184 Ballot papers and certificate to be compared on recount

1 At any recount made as aforesaid the Returning Officer shall produce to the District Court Judge all the used ballot papers, together with the Justice's certificate stating the total number of ballot papers used at the election.

2 If, on comparing the number of ballot papers stated in the certificate with the ballot papers used at the election, the District Court Judge finds that any of the ballot papers have been lost, stolen, or in any way interfered with during the interval between the official count and the recount, the official count made by the Returning Officer shall be deemed to be correct, and the result of the poll declared accordingly. Where in any such case there is an equality of votes between constituency candidates and the addition of a vote would entitle one of those constituency candidates to be declared elected, the Chief Electoral Officer shall determine by lot which candidate shall be elected.



185 Endorsement and return of writ

1 As soon as practicable after the Chief Electoral Officer has, under section 179(2), declared the result for every district, the Chief Electoral Officer must

2 At the end of 6 months, the packets and parcels must be destroyed unopened in the presence of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Chief Electoral Officer.

3 Despite subsection (2), a packet or parcel may not be destroyed so long as the packet or parcel is, or may reasonably be expected to be, required for the purposes of an investigation into, or a prosecution of, an offence against this Act.

190 Papers taken from parcels as evidence in certain cases

191 Election of other members

1 When the Chief Electoral Officer has received from all Returning Officers the information required by section 179(1) of this Act to be forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officer, he or she shall proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names have been included in party lists submitted pursuant to section 127 of this Act have been elected.

2 The Chief Electoral Officer shall first ascertain from the information given under section 179(1)(a) the total number of all the party votes received by each of the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

3 The Chief Electoral Officer shall enter those totals in separate columns under the name of each party in a working sheet in the manner prescribed in form 15.

4 The Chief Electoral Officer shall disregard any total under the name of any party that

a Has not achieved a total that is at least 5 percent of the total number of all the party votes received by all the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote; and

b Is a party in respect of which no constituency candidate who is either

i A candidate for that party; or

ii A candidate for a component party of that party (being a component party that is not listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote but is, in accordance with the details held by the Chief Electoral Officer under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A of this Act, a component party of that party)has had his or her name endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 of this Act as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament.

4A Where the Chief Electoral Officer disregards the name of a party in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, that party shall, for the purpose of this section and sections 192 and 193 of this Act, be deemed to have been deleted from the list of parties included in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

5 The Chief Electoral Officer shall then proceed to divide each of the remaining totals successively by a series of numbers beginning with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and thereafter by every odd number as may be necessary to ensure that the number of seats required to be allocated by this section and sections 192 and 193 of this Act are allocated.

6 The quotient of each successive division shall be recorded on the working sheet.

7 Once the quotient of each successive division is entered on the working sheet, the Chief Electoral Officer shall then proceed to ascertain from a comparison of all the figures in the working sheet in form 15 listed under the heading Quotients of Divisions, the highest 120 quotients or such lower number as is required by subsection (8) of this section.

8 If any person whose name is endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 of this Act as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament, is

a An independent; or

b A member of a political party that did not appear on the list of parties in that part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote (not being a political party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Chief Electoral Officer under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A of this Act, a component party of a political party that did appear on that list),the Chief Electoral Officer shall, for the purposes of applying subsection (7) of this section, deduct from the number of 120 the number of any such persons.

9 In any case where the lowest of the numbers required to be ascertained under subsection (7) of this section constitutes two or more numbers in different columns which are of exactly the same value, the Chief Electoral Officer shall determine by lot which of those numbers is to be selected for the purpose of subsection (7) of this section.

10 The Chief Electoral Officer, having ascertained the numbers required by subsection (7) of this section, shall draw a circle on the working sheet around each of those numbers.

192 Determination of party eligibility for list seats

1 Having ascertained the numbers required by section 191(7) of this Act, the Chief Electoral Officer shall then proceed to ascertain the number of seats in Parliament to which each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote is entitled by adding the number of circles in the column of numbers under the name of that party.

2 Subject to subsection (3) of this section, the Chief Electoral Officer shall then proceed, in respect of each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote, to deduct from the number of seats to which each party is entitled under subsection (1) of this section

a The number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for that party and whose names were endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 of this Act as having been elected as members of Parliament; and

b The number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for a party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Chief Electoral Officer under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A of this Act, a component party of that party and whose names were endorsed on a writ pursuant to section 185 of this Act as having been elected as members of Parliament.

3 The deduction described in subsection (2)(b) of this section shall not be made in respect of constituency seats gained by a component party that is listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.

4 Subject to subsection (5) of this section, after the process of deduction described in subsection (2) of this section has been completed in respect of each party, the remainder derived therefrom shall be the number of seats to be allocated to that party from the list of candidates submitted pursuant to section 127 of this Act.

5 If any party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote has obtained, through the election of any of its constituency candidates or any of the constituency candidates for any party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Chief Electoral Officer under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A of this Act, a component party of that party or both, a number of seats that is equal to or greater than the total number of seats in Parliament to which it would be entitled under subsection (1) of this section, that party shall not be allocated any seats from the list of candidates submitted by that party pursuant to section 127 of this Act, but the seats of the constituency candidates of that party who have been elected as members of Parliament shall not be affected.

193 Selection of candidates

1 Upon completing the procedures outlined in section 192 of this Act, the Chief Electoral Officer shall proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names appear on the list submitted pursuant to section 127 of this Act by each of the parties listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote are entitled to be elected.

2 The Chief Electoral Officer shall determine which candidates are entitled to be elected by selecting those candidates on the list of each party, beginning with the first candidate on the list and ending with the lowest ranking candidate, which are equal in number to the number of seats to which that party is entitled to have allocated from its list submitted pursuant to section 127 of this Act.

3 In performing the duties required by subsection (2) of this section, the Chief Electoral Officer shall disregard the name of any candidate whose name has been endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 of this Act, and the name of that candidate shall be deemed to have been deleted from the list submitted pursuant to section 127 of this Act.

4 Where all the candidates appearing on a list submitted by a party pursuant to section 127 of this Act are entitled to be selected, no further candidates for that party may be selected, notwithstanding that the party may be entitled to a greater number of seats than the number of candidates appearing on that list and those seats shall not be filled.

5 The Chief Electoral Officer shall, as soon as practicable after selecting the full names of those candidates entitled to be elected,

a Declare those candidates to be elected by publishing in the Gazette the names of the members elected; and

b Forward to the Clerk of the House of Representatives a return listing the names of the members elected.

6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any provision of sections 191 and 192 of this Act, the Chief Electoral Officer may proceed to select the names of those candidates entitled to be elected from lists submitted under section 127 of this Act, by such method and procedure as he or she thinks fit, including the use of computer technology:Provided that, before declaring any candidates to be elected under subsection (5) of this section, he or she shall complete the procedures required by sections 191 and 192 of this Act and this section.
