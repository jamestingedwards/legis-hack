a an injunction:

b a civil remedy order under section 33I:

c a compensatory order:

d a pecuniary penalty order and declaration of contravention (on application by the Panel only).

2 See section 2(2) for the definition of contravention of the takeovers code in this subpart.

3 This section is a guide only to the general scheme and effect of this subpart.



33F What court may injunct
The court may, on application by any person in accordance with section 35, grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of the takeovers code.

33G When court may grant injunctions and interim injunctions

1 The court may grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct of a particular kind if

a it is satisfied that the person has engaged in conduct of that kind; or

b it appears to the court that, if an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the person will engage in conduct of that kind.

2 The court may grant an interim injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct of a particular kind if in its opinion it is desirable to do so.

3 Subsections (1)(a) and (2) apply whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind.

4 Subsections (1)(b) and (2) apply whether or not

a the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind:

b there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any other person if that person engages in conduct of that kind.

1 If the Panel applies to the court for the grant of an interim injunction under this subpart, the court must not, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, require the Panel to give an undertaking as to damages.

2 However, in determining the Panel's application for the grant of an interim injunction, the court must not take into account that the Panel is not required to give an undertaking as to damages.

m require a person to comply with any provision of the takeovers code even though the time for doing so may have expired.



33K When court may make compensatory orders

1 The court may make a compensatory order, on application by any person in accordance with section 35, if the court is satisfied that

a there is a contravention of the takeovers code; and

b a person (the aggrieved person) has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the contravention.

2 The court may make a compensatory order whether or not the aggrieved person is a party to the proceedings.

33L Terms of compensatory orders
If section 33K applies, the court may make any order it thinks just to compensate an aggrieved person in whole or in part for the loss or damage, or to prevent or reduce that loss or damage, including an order (without limitation) to

a direct the person in contravention to pay to the aggrieved person the amount of the loss or damage:

b direct the person in contravention to refund money or return property to the aggrieved person:

c if a contract has been entered into between the person in contravention and the aggrieved person,

ii cancel the contract and, if the court thinks fit, declare the cancellation to have had effect on and after a date before the order was made, as specified in the order:

iii require the person in contravention to take any action the court thinks fit to reinstate the parties as near as may be possible to their former positions.



33M When court may make pecuniary penalty orders and declarations of contravention
If the Panel applies for a pecuniary penalty order against a person under this Act in accordance with section 35, the court

a must determine whether the person has contravened the takeovers code; and

b must make a declaration of contravention (see sections33N and 33O) if satisfied that the person has contravened the takeovers code; and

c may order the person to pay a pecuniary penalty that the court considers appropriate to the Crown (see sections 33P and 33Q) if satisfied that the person has contravened the takeovers code, that the person knew or ought to have known of the conduct that constituted the contravention, and that the contravention

i materially prejudices the interests of offerees, the code company, the offeror or acquirer, competing offerors, or any other person involved in or affected by a transaction or event that is or will be regulated by the takeovers code, or that is incidental or preliminary to a transaction or event of that kind; or

ii is likely to materially damage the integrity or reputation of any of New Zealand's securities markets; or

iii is otherwise serious.

33N Purpose and effect of declarations of contravention

1 The purpose of a declaration of contravention is to enable an applicant for a civil remedy order under section 33I or a compensatory order under section 33K to rely on the declaration of contravention in the proceedings for that order, and not be required to prove the contravention.

2 Accordingly, a declaration of contravention is conclusive evidence of the matters that must be stated in it under section 33O.

33O What declarations of contravention must state
A declaration of contravention must state the following:

a the court that made the declaration; and

b the provision of the takeovers code to which the contravention relates or, if the contravention is of an exemption, both the term or condition contravened and the takeovers code provision to which the exemption relates; and

c the person in contravention; and

d the conduct that constituted the contravention and, if a transaction constituted the contravention, the transaction; and

e the code company to which the conduct related.

33P Maximum amount of pecuniary penalty
The maximum amount of a pecuniary penalty is $500,000 for an individual and $5,000,000 for a body corporate, for each contravention.

33Q Considerations for court in determining pecuniary penalty
In determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty, the court must have regard to all relevant matters, including

a the principles contained in the takeovers code; and

b the nature and extent of the contravention; and

c the likelihood, nature, and extent of any damage to the integrity or reputation of any of New Zealand's securities markets because of the contravention; and

d the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered by a person referred to in section 33M(c)(i) because of the contravention; and

e the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

f whether or not the person in contravention has previously been found by the court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.

33R Court must order that recovery from pecuniary penalty be applied to Panel's actual costs
If the court orders that a person pay a pecuniary penalty, and the proceedings were brought (in whole or in part) by the Panel, the court must also order that the penalty must be applied first to pay the Panel's actual costs in bringing the proceedings.
