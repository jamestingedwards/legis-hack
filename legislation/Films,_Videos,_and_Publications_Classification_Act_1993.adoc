1 For the purposes of this Act, a publication is objectionable if it describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, or violence in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.

1A Without limiting subsection (1), a publication deals with a matter such as sex for the purposes of that subsection if

a the publication is or contains 1 or more visual images of 1 or more children or young persons who are nude or partially nude; and

b those 1 or more visual images are, alone, or together with any other contents of the publication, reasonably capable of being regarded as sexual in nature.

1B Subsection (1A) is for the avoidance of doubt.

2 A publication shall be deemed to be objectionable for the purposes of this Act if the publication promotes or supports, or tends to promote or support,

a The exploitation of children, or young persons, or both, for sexual purposes; or

b The use of violence or coercion to compel any person to participate in, or submit to, sexual conduct; or

c Sexual conduct with or upon the body of a dead person; or

d The use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct; or

e Bestiality; or

f Acts of torture or the infliction of extreme violence or extreme cruelty.

3 In determining, for the purposes of this Act, whether or not any publication (other than a publication to which subsection (2) of this section applies) is objectionable or should in accordance with section 23(2) be given a classification other than objectionable, particular weight shall be given to the extent and degree to which, and the manner in which, the publication

a Describes, depicts, or otherwise deals with

i Acts of torture, the infliction of serious physical harm, or acts of significant cruelty:

ii Sexual violence or sexual coercion, or violence or coercion in association with sexual conduct:

iii Other sexual or physical conduct of a degrading or dehumanising or demeaning nature:

4 In determining, for the purposes of this Act, whether or not any publication (other than a publication to which subsection (2) of this section applies) is objectionable or should in accordance with section 23(2) be given a classification other than objectionable, the following matters shall also be considered:

a The dominant effect of the publication as a whole:

b The impact of the medium in which the publication is presented:

c The character of the publication, including any merit, value, or importance that the publication has in relation to literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational, scientific, or other matters:

d The persons, classes of persons, or age groups of the persons to whom the publication is intended or is likely to be made available:

e The purpose for which the publication is intended to be used:

f Any other relevant circumstances relating to the intended or likely use of the publication.

3A Publication may be age-restricted if it contains highly offensive language likely to cause serious harm

1 A publication to which subsection (2) applies may be classified as a restricted publication under section 23(2)(c)(i).

2 This subsection applies to a publication that contains highly offensive language to such an extent or degree that the availability of the publication would be likely, if not restricted to persons who have attained a specified age, to cause serious harm to persons under that age.

3 In this section, *highly offensive language* means language that is highly offensive to the public in general.

3B Publication may be age-restricted if likely to be injurious to public good for specified reasons

1 A publication to which subsection (2) applies may be classified as a restricted publication under section 23(2)(c)(i).

2 This subsection applies to a publication that contains material specified in subsection (3) to such an extent or degree that the availability of the publication would, if not restricted to persons who have attained a specified age, be likely to be injurious to the public good for any or all of the reasons specified in subsection (4).

3 The material referred to in subsection (2) is material that

a describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with

i harm to a person's body whether it involves infliction of pain or not (for example, self-mutilation or similarly harmful body modification) or self-inflicted death; or

ii conduct that, if imitated, would pose a real risk of serious harm to self or others or both; or

iii physical conduct of a degrading or dehumanising or demeaning nature; or

b is or includes 1 or more visual images

i of a person's body; and

ii that, alone, or together with any other contents of the publication, are of a degrading or dehumanising or demeaning nature.

4 The reasons referred to in subsection (2) are that the general levels of emotional and intellectual development and maturity of persons under the specified age mean that the availability of the publication to those persons would be likely to

a cause them to be greatly disturbed or shocked; or

b increase significantly the risk of them killing, or causing serious harm to, themselves, others, or both; or

c encourage them to treat or regard themselves, others, or both, as degraded or dehumanised or demeaned.

3C Procedure for classification under sections 3A and 3B
In determining whether to classify a publication as a restricted publication in accordance with section 3A or section 3B, the Classification Office must consider the matters specified in paragraphs (a) to (f) of section 3(4).

Sections 3A and 3B are not limited by section 3, and do not limit the Classification Office's power under sections 3 and 23(2)(c) to classify a publication as a restricted publication.

4 Classification of publications a matter of expert judgment

1 The question whether or not a publication is objectionable or should in accordance with section 23(2) be given a classification other than objectionable is a matter for the expert judgment of the person or body authorised or required, by or pursuant to this Act, to determine it, and evidence as to, or proof of, any of the matters or particulars that the person or body is required to consider in determining that question is not essential to its determination.

2 Without limiting subsection (1) of this section, where evidence as to, or proof of, any such matters or particulars is available to the body or person concerned, that body or person shall take that evidence or proof into consideration.

29 Character of publications arising in court proceedings

1 Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, where in any civil or criminal proceedings before a court (including any proceedings under section 116 of this Act) a question arises whether any publication

32 Excisions from and alterations to films
Notwithstanding anything in section 23 of this Act, if, after examining a film under this Part of this Act (other than a film referred to it pursuant to section 29(1) or section 41(3) of this Act), the Classification Office is of the opinion that it would classify the film differently according to whether any specified part or parts of the film are excised from or left in the film, it shall, before making a final determination in respect of the classification of the film, follow the procedure prescribed by section 33 of this Act.

33 Procedure for making excisions and alterations

1 In any case to which section 32 of this Act applies, the Classification Office shall notify the authorised distributor of the film of

a The classification that the Classification Office would give to the film if any specified part or parts of the film were excised or altered to the satisfaction of the Classification Office; and

b The classification that the Classification Office would give to the film if the specified part or parts of the film were not excised or altered to the satisfaction of the Classification Office.

2 If the authorised distributor of the film agrees to each such excision or alteration to the satisfaction of the Classification Office, the Classification Office shall classify that film in accordance with section 23 of this Act as if each of the required excisions and alterations were made.

3 If the authorised distributor of the film refuses or fails, within 20 working days after the date of the Classification Office's notice, or within such further period as the Classification Office may allow, to agree to any such alteration or excision to the satisfaction of the Classification Office, the Classification Office shall classify the film in accordance with section 23 of this Act.

4 If the authorised distributor of the film agrees to some but not all of the excisions or alterations, the Classification Office shall classify the film in accordance with section 23 of this Act as if the excisions and alterations agreed to by the authorised distributor of the film had been made.

5 In determining whether to exercise, or in exercising, the Classification Office's powers under this section in respect of any film, the Classification Office may consider the effect that any such excision or alteration may have on the continuity of the film or on its overall effect.

34 Classification to apply only if excisions and alterations actually made
Where, pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (4) of section 33 of this Act, the Classification Office classifies any film as if certain excisions or alterations had been made to that film,

a That classification shall apply in respect of that film only if those excisions or alterations are in fact made; and

b The Classification Office shall not direct the labelling body to issue a label in respect of that film unless the Classification Office is satisfied that those excisions or alterations have been made.

35 Provisions to apply to soundtracks
Sections 32 to 34 of this Act, so far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifications, shall apply with respect to any soundtrack intended to accompany the viewing of any film being examined.

2 Where the Classification Office has examined and classified a film submitted to it under section 13 or section 42 of this Act, or referred to it pursuant to section 29(1) or section 41(3) of this Act, the Classification Office may, subject to section 34(b) of this Act, if the Classification Office is satisfied that the film is available for public supply or public exhibition, or is intended to be made available for public supply or public exhibition, direct the labelling body to issue a label in respect of that film.

3 Every direction under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall specify, in respect of the film,

a Either,

i Where the Classification Office has classified the film as unrestricted, the rating to be assigned to that film; or

ii Where the Classification Office has classified the film as a restricted publication, the classification of that film; and

b Where appropriate, the description to be assigned to that film; and

c Where, pursuant to section 27 of this Act, the Classification Office has imposed conditions on the public display of the film, or any film poster relating to the film, or both, those conditions.

4 The Classification Office shall not direct the labelling body to issue a label in respect of any film that the Classification Office has classified as objectionable.

5 Where, under subsection (2) of this section, the Classification Office directs the labelling body to issue a label in respect of any film, any label previously issued in respect of that film by the labelling body, and any previous direction by the Classification Office to the labelling body to issue a label in respect of that film, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be cancelled.

36A Issue of labels in respect of other publications that are classified as restricted publications

1 This subsection applies to a publication (other than a film) if the Classification Office has

a examined the publication and classified it as a restricted publication; and

b imposed pursuant to section 27(4)(a) a condition requiring the classification given to the publication to be shown when it is on public display.

2 If subsection (1) applies to a publication, the Classification Office must direct the labelling body to issue in respect of the publication a label that specifies the classification given to the publication.

1 Where it has been determined under this Act that no fewer than 3 issues of a serial publication that have been published within a period of not more than 12 months are objectionable or are restricted publications, the Classification Office may, where any issue of that publication is before the Classification Office for the purposes of this Part of this Act, make an order (in this section called a serial publication order) in respect of that serial publication.

2 The Classification Office shall not make a serial publication order the effect of which is that issues of a serial publication will be treated as objectionable, unless the Classification Office is satisfied that, having regard to the issues of that serial publication that have been classified as objectionable, issues of that serial publication that are published while the order is in force would be likely to be classified as objectionable.

3 Every serial publication order

a Shall show whether the issues of the serial publication to which it relates are to be treated as objectionable or as restricted publications and, in the latter case, particulars of the classification; and

b Shall come into force on the day after the date of its entry in the register; and

5 While any serial publication order is in force in respect of any serial publication, no person shall do any act or thing in relation to any issue to which the order applies (other than an issue that has been classified by the Classification Office or the Board) that would be an offence against any of sections 123 to 129 of this Act if that issue were an objectionable publication or a restricted publication, as the serial publication order may require.

6 Where, pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the Classification Office, as part of any serial publication order, includes any condition on the public display of the issues to which the order applies, or any advertising posters relating to those issues, or both, then, while that serial publication order is in force in respect of that serial publication, no person shall do any act or thing in relation to any such issue or, as the case requires, any such advertising poster that would be an offence against section 130 of this Act if that issue were a restricted publication and that condition had been imposed pursuant to section 27 of this Act.

7 Nothing in subsection (6) of this section applies in respect of any issue that has been classified by the Classification Office or the Board.

2 Subject to this section and to section 155 of this Act, every decision to which this section applies shall be deemed for the purposes of sections 41 and 42 of this Act to be a decision made under section 23 of this Act by the Classification Office on the date of the making of that decision under the Indecent Publications Act 1963, and for those purposes the book or sound recording to which the decision relates shall be deemed to have the classification that corresponds as near as may be to the classification or character assigned to it by that decision under that Act.

3 For the purposes of section 39 of this Act, where notice of a decision to which this section applies has been published in the Gazette, that decision shall be deemed to have been entered in, and to form part of, the register.
