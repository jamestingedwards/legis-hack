a to the extent (if any) that the third party has agreed that

2 Subject to subsection (3), where any loan raised by the issue of debentures or stock in respect of which an area health board is (or, immediately before the transfer, was) liable, is transferred by or pursuant to this Act, the transferee shall succeed to the same rights and obligations in respect of any sinking fund established in order to provide money for the repayment of that loan as the area health board had immediately prior to the transfer.

10 Assets to remain subject to trusts

11 Assets held in trust

1 If an asset is held in trust by a transferor or transferee, the Minister may request the Attorney-General to determine either, or both, of the following matters:

a whether, and to whom, the asset should be transferred:

b the extent to which the terms of the trust should be modified.

2 The proceeds of any sale effected pursuant to subsection (1), and the land or money obtained by any exchange effected pursuant to subsection (1), are to be subject, so far as may be practicable, to the same trusts as the land so disposed of, or to any similar trusts that the Attorney-General may approve.

3 Nothing in this section applies to

a any public reserve within the meaning of the Reserves Act 1977; or

b any Crown endowment land.

4 In respect of any land held in trust, the power of sale conferred by subsection (1) may not be exercised if the sale of the land is expressly prohibited by a term of the trust.

5 Any question as to whether subsection (4) prevents the sale of any land may be determined by the Attorney-General.

6 No mortgage or charge given by a DHB in respect of any land that is held in trust for any purpose may contain or imply any power of sale of the land, whether or not the mortgage or charge purports to do so.

11B Power of Minister of Health to cancel Crown endowment

1 The Minister of Health may, by written notice given to a DHB, declare that any land vested in the DHB (being land that the Attorney-General has, by written notice to the Minister of Health, declared to be Crown endowment land) is no longer subject to the Crown endowment.

2 Where a notice is given by the Minister of Health under subsection (1), from the date of the notice the land

a ceases to be subject to the Crown endowment; and

b subject to clause 43 of Schedule 3 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, may be sold, exchanged, mortgaged, charged, or otherwise dealt with by the DHB free from the terms of the Crown endowment.

3 The Attorney-General may declare any land vested in a DHB to be Crown endowment land for the purposes of subsection(1) even if either or both of the following applies:

a the purpose of the Crown endowment can no longer be attained or ascertained:

b it is uncertain whether the land is Crown endowment land.

11C Power of DHB to apply proceeds of sale of Crown endowment land

1 Subject to subsection (2), where a DHB holds in trust the proceeds of the sale of any land (being land that was, at the time of the sale, subject to a Crown endowment), the DHB may, despite the terms of that endowment, and whether the land was sold before or after the commencement of this section, apply the proceeds of the sale

a for the purposes of any health services or disability support services, or both, provided by the DHB; or

b for any purpose for which the DHB may lawfully apply its own property.

2 The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised in respect of the proceeds of the sale of any land only if the Attorney-General, by written notice given to the DHB, declares that the land sold (whether before or after the commencement of this section) was Crown endowment land.

3 A notice may be given under subsection (2) in respect of land sold by a DHB even if either or both of the following applies:

a the purpose of the Crown endowment can no longer be attained or ascertained:

b it is uncertain whether the land sold was Crown endowment land.

11D Saving in respect of Charitable Trusts Act 1957
Nothing in this Act prevents a DHB from exercising the rights conferred on trustees by Part 3 of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.

11E Health sector reserves

1 In this section, *health sector reserve* means any land vested in a transferee that is a reserve within the meaning of the Reserves Act 1977.

2 Every health sector reserve is deemed to be classified, under the Reserves Act 1977, as a Government purpose reserve for the purpose of the health and disability sector and for related purposes.

3 Every health sector reserve may be transferred under this Act to any transferee, whether or not the transferee is in the health and disability sector.

4 Every transferee to whom a health sector reserve is transferred under this Act is an administering body under the Reserves Act 1977 in respect of that reserve, except that neither section25(3) of that Act nor Part 4 of that Act applies to the transferee or to the reserve.

5 A transferee outside the health and disability sector to whom a health sector reserve is transferred under this Act must, as soon as practicable, promote either of the following:

a an appropriate change of classification or purpose of the health sector reserve under the Reserves Act 1977:

b the revocation, under that Act, of the reservation of the health sector reserve as a reserve.

6 If the reservation of any health sector reserve is revoked under the Reserves Act 1977, then, despite any enactment, from the date of the revocation the land comprising the former health sector reserve

a remains vested in the transferee; and

b is subject to any reservations or trusts affecting that land arising from Acts (other than the Reserves Act 1977 or any other Act by which the former status as a reserve was conferred or confirmed), Provincial Ordinances, wills, deeds, or other instruments; and

c is subject to clause 3 of Schedule 1 if it is public work land within the meaning of that clause; and

d is subject to any valid leases, rights, easements, or interests subsisting over that land at the date of the revocation.

7 Despite the Reserves Act 1977, a lease or licence may be granted over a health sector reserve for health-related purposes or, with the consent of the Minister, for any other purposes.

8 The granting of a lease or licence under subsection (7) is subject to,

a if granted by a publicly-owned health and disability organisation or a subsidiary of such an organisation, clause 43 of Schedule 3 or clause 28 of Schedule 6 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, as the case may require; and

b if granted by a transferee that is not a publicly-owned health and disability organisation or a subsidiary of such an organisation, clause 43 of Schedule 3 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, as if that clause applied, with all necessary modifications, to the transferee.

9 Any payment under a lease or licence over a health sector reserve may be paid to the transferee in whom the reserve is vested, and may be applied for the purposes of the transferee.

10 To avoid any doubt, nothing in this Act permits the Minister to alter the status of a health sector reserve without complying with all processes required by the Reserves Act 1977, including the processes under that Act that require changes in status to be approved by the Minister of Conservation.

11F Saving in respect of Public Works Act 1981
Nothing in sections 11A to 11E limits the application of clause3 of Schedule 1 to land to which that clause applies.

11G Saving in respect of Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995 and Ngi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998
Nothing in sections 11A to 11E limits the application of

a section 11 of the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995; or

b Part 9 of the Ngi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

11H Part 4A of Conservation Act 1987

1 Subject to subsections (2) to (5), the provisions of Part 4A of the Conservation Act 1987 apply, with all necessary modifications, in relation to every sale or other disposition of land by a transferee as if that disposition of land were a sale or other disposition of land by the Crown.

2 The provisions of Part 4A of the Conservation Act 1987 do not apply in relation to any sale or other disposition of land by a transferee if the land sold or otherwise disposed of

a is land that,

i before being transferred to, or vested in, the transferee under this Act or the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, had been given to the Crown, a DHB, or any predecessors in title of a DHB; and

ii is being sold or disposed of to the donor of the land or to the successor of the donor of the land (being the person who would have been entitled to the land under the will or intestacy of the donor had the donor owned the land at the date of the donor's death); or

b is land acquired by the transferee other than land acquired by virtue of

i the operation of section 95 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000; or

ii a transfer under this Act; or

c is land being transferred to or vested in the Crown.

12 Transfer of employees by agreement or Order in Council

1 Where the rights and obligations of a transferor under a contract of service between the transferor and an employee of the transferor are transferred to a transferee under section 4 or section 5, except as otherwise specified in the agreement, proposal, or Order in Council,

a the employee shall, with effect from the commencement of the transfer date, become an employee of the transferee; and the contract of service shall, from the commencement of that date, apply as a contract between the employee and the transferee; and

b the contract of service shall be deemed to have been unbroken and the employee's period of service with the transferor, and every other period of service of the employee that is recognised by the transferor as continuous service, shall be deemed to have been a period of service with the transferee; and

c the employee shall be employed by the transferee with effect from the commencement of the transfer date in the same or substantially the same capacity as the capacity in which the employee is employed immediately before the transfer date; and

d the employee shall not be entitled to receive any payment or other benefit (including a benefit under any superannuation scheme) by reason of

i the transfer; or

ii the employee ceasing to be an employee of the transferor; or

iii any change in the capacity in which the employee is employed, so long as the new capacity is substantially the same as the previous capacity.

2 Where any rights and obligations of a transferor under a contract of service arise by virtue of a collective employment contract and such rights and obligations are transferred to a transferee under section 4 or section 5, that collective employment contract shall be deemed, as from the commencement of the transfer date (or such other time as is specified in the agreement, proposal, or Order in Council), to continue to apply on the same terms (including any terms relating to new employees) as if it were a contract made between the transferee, any bargaining agent that is a party to it, and the employee.

13 Restrictions on redundancy and other entitlements

1 Where an employee of a transferor receives a reasonable offer of employment from any transferee on or before the date on which the employee ceases to be employed by the transferor, being an offer of employment on terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applying to the employee at the date on which the employee ceases to be employed by the transferor, then, except as otherwise determined by the Minister but notwithstanding the terms of that employee's contract of service with the transferor, the employee shall not be entitled to receive any payment or other benefit from the transferor by reason of so ceasing, whether or not the employee accepts that offer of employment from the transferee.

2 Where an employee of a transferor ceases for any reason (including redundancy) to be an employee of the transferor but is employed (in any capacity) by a transferee within 9months of so ceasing (whether or not that employment with the transferee commenced before the employee ceased employment with the transferor), then, notwithstanding the terms of that employee's contract of service with the transferor,

a the entitlement of that employee to receive or to retain any payment or other benefit from the transferor or from any other person by reason of so ceasing shall be determined in accordance with a scale fixed by the Minister; and

b if such a payment or other benefit has been paid to or for the benefit of the employee, the employee shall repay all or such part of the payment or other benefit in accordance with a scale fixed by the Minister.

3 In fixing a scale for the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister shall have regard to the period that has elapsed between the employee ceasing to be employed by the transferor and becoming an employee of a transferee.

4 Every amount payable by an employee under subsection (2)(b) shall constitute a debt due from the employee to the person who paid it (or, if that person was an area health board, to the Crown Health Financing Agency) and may be recovered accordingly.

5 The Minister may vary a scale in respect of a particular employee where the Minister is satisfied that

a undue hardship to the employee would otherwise result; or

b it is reasonable to do so having regard to the extent to which the employee's terms and conditions of employment with the transferee differ from those with the transferor.

6 This section shall apply only to those employees who cease to be employed by a transferor on or before 31December 1994.

14 National Provident superannuation schemes
Where

a the rights and obligations of a transferor under a contract of service between the transferor and an employee of the transferor are transferred to a transferee under section 4 or section 5; and

b the employee was, immediately before the date on which the transfer takes effect, a member of a superannuation scheme of which the Board of Trustees of the National Provident Fund is trustee; and

c the transferor was, immediately before that date, a corporate contributor to that scheme,the transferee shall on and from that date be obliged to contribute to that scheme in respect of that employee in accordance with the terms of the scheme and shall be deemed to be a local authority for the purposes of section 40 of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990.

15 Application of Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956

1 For the purposes of the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956, a person who, at any time before 31March1994, becomes an employee of a transferee and who, immediately before becoming such an employee, was an officer or employee of a transferor and was a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund under that Act shall, so long as that person continues to be employed by a transferee, be deemed to be employed in the Government service and that Act shall be deemed to apply to that person as if service with the transferee were Government service.

2 Subject to the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956, nothing in subsection (1) shall entitle any such person to become a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund after that person has ceased to be a contributor.

3 For the purposes of applying the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956, in accordance with subsection (1), to a person who is in the service of a transferee and is a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund, the term *controlling authority*, in relation to that person, means the chief executive of the transferee.
