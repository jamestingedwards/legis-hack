a The whole or part of any historic place, historic area, wahi tapu, or wahi tapu area; and

b Such area of land (if any) surrounding that historic place, historic area, wahi tapu, or wahi tapu area as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of ensuring the protection and reasonable enjoyment of it.



6 Heritage covenants

1 Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the Trust may negotiate and agree with the owner or lessee or licensee of any historic place, historic area, wahi tapu, or wahi tapu area for the execution of a heritage covenant to provide for the protection, conservation, and maintenance of that place, area, or wahi tapu.

2 For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that

b Nothing in any heritage covenant shall permit or allow any person to carry out any act contrary to the provisions of this Act.

1 Every heritage covenant

a Shall be deemed to be an instrument creating an interest in the land within the meaning of section 62 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 and may be registered accordingly; and

b Shall be deemed to be a covenant running with the land when registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 and shall bind all subsequent owners of the land.

2 Where a heritage covenant has been registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 and any provision in that covenant has been varied or cancelled by any agreement under section 6(4) of this Act or has expired, the District Land Registrar shall, if he or she is satisfied that any provision in that covenant has been so varied or cancelled or has expired, make an entry in the register and on any relevant instrument of title noting that the heritage covenant has been varied or cancelled or has expired, and the provisions of the heritage covenant shall take effect as so varied or cease to have any effect, as the case may be.
